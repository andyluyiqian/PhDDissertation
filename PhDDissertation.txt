\begin{section*}{\textbf{Preface}}


It’s a long journey to pursuit my Doctorate Degree in Economics. I would like to express my sincere gratefulness to my advisor Dr. Neel Rao, for his continuous support on my dissertation as well as the pursuit of truth and happiness of Economics Science. My other current and past committee members Dr. Mingliang Li, Dr. Yun Pei and Dr. Goncalo Monteiro also educated me several important classes and encouraged me during difficulties. 

Economics is really a beautiful subject fulfilled with rigorous logical thinking, elegant quantitative modelling and detailed empirical verification. My dissertation is composed of four chapters, focusing on the a variety of topics of labor economics and applied econometric. 

Chapter one discusses the innovation fluctuation in an aging economy. A three-stage overlapping generations model is constructed to mimic the population trend and its consequent impact on innovation and economics development. Both the theoretical analysis and empirical modification shows that countries with low fertility rate have higher innovation rate in the short period but lower rate in the long time horizon. This chapter discusses the negative impact of an aging economy and is lean to strong policy implication of increasing subsidy to increase the fertility rate, particularly for those developed European countries suffering from aging problem in the foreseeable future.

Chapter two focuses on the relationship between unemployment rate, working efficiency and work-over-time problem. It is motivated by the widely observed phenomenon in some east Asian countries and consulting, investment banking sectors in the United States. Does working overtime indeed produce extra efficiency? I use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data to answer this question. The answer is NO and it has little impact on the unemployment rate. This chapter contributes to existing literature with a new empirical approach. It could also guide corporate management professionals to enact proper overtime working policy.

Chapter three debates the heated-discussion of the relationship between institutions and economics outcome. The prestigious MIT and Chicago political economist Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson argues that only inclusive political and economics institution could lead to economic prosperity. Other scholars dispute their theory don’t catch the whole picture. Bill Gates said the theory of Acemoglu and Robinson must take into account other important factors and this chapter contributes to this gap. I find that economics prosperity could be harvested even in the extractive institutions with immigration-friendly policies. That said, countries like United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Singapore could enjoy the long-term economics boom with good immigration policy by attracting high-skilled and low-skilled immigrants of their Neighbors. 

Chapter four intends to figure out the empirical relationship between income inequality and consumption inequality in China. Existing empirical literature show the consumption inequality outnumbers income inequality in China, which contradicts basic economics theory as well as evidence from US, Canada and Europe. I use the inverse relationship between necessity good consumption and income to impute the true income level of each individuals. High income communist party members and government-related agency employees tend to hide their grey income and the income inequality is thus underestimated. The real income-consumption inequality relationship is consistent with the empirical evident in other countries.

I wish to thank the department of Economics of University at Buffalo providing financial support during my graduate study. This dissertation benefits from many heated discussion with my fellow classmates Xu Guo, Yiru Wang, Yenan Sun, Bibaswan Chatterjee and especially Jinquan Gong. I presented some chapters of my dissertation at MassPRIM investment board, Analysis Group, Midwest Economics Conference and all the remarks from Eric Nierenberg, Bill Li, Edward Wang, Michael Trotsky, Mike McGirr, Michael Bailey, Na Datson, Ching Watson, Xuan Jiang and Xiaosheng Mu. My friends Jun Chu, Rujie Yin, Zhimo Shen, Menghui Wang, Heming Shou, Yuanpei Cao provides first-hand knowledge, continuous encouragement and detailed feedback from various angles to my dissertation. I also treasure the legacy of Professor Gary Becker from the University of Chicago. Becker's work has traversed the entire gamut of the social sciences and demonstrates the elegance and simplicity of economics to me.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents Guoqiang Lu, Dongmei Qian and my wife Jincheng Zhang, who give me live and nurture me from my childhood and college. My dissertation could not be finished without their love.

\begin{section} {Chapter 1: Population Structure and Innovation Level}
\subsection{Introduction}


Income, inequality and innovation level remain in the central topics of the economics development. From Adam Smith (The Wealth of Nations, 1776) to Acemoglu (Why Nations Fail, 2012), thousands of scholars tend to discuss this pivotal topic from culture background, geographic influence, climate change, political roles, education influence, etc.. In the more recent studies, people tend to illustrate this crucial topic from the aspect of population structure and fertility rate (James Liang 2010, Wenzheng Huang, Jianxing Li 2012, Fuxian Yi 2013). Current literature (Isaac Ehrlich and Jinyoung Kim, 2004) pointed out an inverted-U sharped relationship between the output per capita and fertility rate, which could be empirically demonstrated by the survey data around the world. It could be explained that the fertility rate grows gradually because of the better medical condition and nutrition when the output per capita starts at a very low level while drops when output per capital exceeds a threshold because of the high opportunity cost (promotion opportunity, leisure, pecuniary expenditure loss) of raising kids. 

The majority literature of economics development(Solow 1957, Romer 1986, etc.) discuss the issues on growth rate, economic inequality and social welfare under the steady population growth rate or constant population structure. This is mainly because the world experiences  steady population growth after WWII. Baby boomers after the end of the Second World War contribute to the economy throughout most developed and developing countries. However, the picture of the next few decades don't guarantee us the assumption that we have a steady population growth rate and a nice overlapping generation structure anymore. Most developed countries experienced low birth rate in the recent 20 years such as Japan(1.40), South Korea (1.25) and Singapore (0.81) according to CIA data. And even worse, some developing countries experienced dramatic fertility drop under relentless birth control policies. For instance, the fertility rate of China drops from 5.5 in 1960s to 1.18  in the year 2010 (2010 Population Census, National Bureau of Statistics of China) under the One-Child Policy. Uzbekistan government removed uterus of women who gave birth to 2 children under the dictatorship of Islam Karimov (Acemoglu 2012).  These short-sighted anti-human policies crush out the light of future economics growth in those developing countries. (Acemoglu 2012, Joe Biden and Hilliary Clinton 2013, James Liang 2010, ).

In this paper, I attempt to figure out how a rational person make selection between the rational choice of  raising more kids, starting up a new business and working as a employee for paycheck during his adulthood life. I believe the  low fertility  phenomenon that is observed in most developed countries and some developing countries are because of the following reasons. \\
(1) The compulsory education system and the increasing popularity of college education lower the length of possible childbearing years. Typically speaking a female has 15 to 20 years of possible childbearing age while modern education system (college level and graduate level education) reduced this period by 3 to 5 years.\\
(2) The opportunity cost of giving birth to next generation is high with the wage compensation increasing. In other word, the shadow price paying to bear a child increases with economics development. The opportunity cost rockets under the background that the whole society suffers a low fertility rate. It is estimated (Gary Becker 1986, James Liang 2012) that the marginal cost of raising an additional kid in a high fertility country is far less than in a low fertility one. Parents would race on the education competition if they have only one child. The win-or-lose-all altitude leads to a significant price hike on child-bearing and education. As a result, if a country stepped into low fertility dilemma, it is extremely hard for this country to get rid of it. For instance, those countries where experience low fertility encourage bearing more children by providing thousands of dollars subsidies (Korea, Japan, Singapore) but the policy does not make sense as thousands of dollars subsidies are way too less. \\
(3) People's preference are more realistic and less altruistic to the next generation with economics development. That is to say, people are becoming careless about their children welfare after their own death since they cannot see the welfare anymore after their decease. More couples tend to become DINK (double income with no kids) since they care less about  next generation, particularly under a more developed pension and social security system.  Those countries having a worse social security system do not suffer from the low fertility since the incentive for raising more kids are enormous. From the famous soft budget constraint explanation (Yingyi Qian, 1996) approach, it could be explained people tend to misuse the social security (public resources from next generation) without paying enough expenditure (raising more kids), particularly in Europe.  People believe government will pay them after retirement even if they don't pay anything for next generation's tax revenue (the expenditure of raising kids).  The completeness and greatness of social security systems encourage "lazy" couples to raise less children, which paying less cost for future government tax revenue.

It is  widely believed (Gary Becker 1971, EA Hanushek 1992, H Li, J Zhang, Y Zhu 2008) that there  are trade off between the quantity and quality of children. Those scholars  argue with less kids there will be better education and human capital accumulation for offspring. As a result, the rational choice of the number of children should be on the balance point of marginal benefit of an additional kids equaling to marginal benefit of increasing quality of preexisting kids. However, more recent study (J Angrist, V Lavy, A Schlosser, 2010) points out there are no causal link between the quality and the quantity of the children. Wenzheng Huang and James Liang (2012) describe there are no statistical significant quality difference between the single child and non-single child, which is somehow counter-intuitive. The Nobel Laureate Gary Becker told his last student James Liang before his passing that even if there is trade-off, it is still extremely wrong and silly for Chinese government to adopt the One Child Policy. Feng Wang, Y Cai, B Gu (2013) argued that history will give more negative judgment on Chinese absurd One Child Policy in the next few decades, which "is even worse than Culture Revolution and  Planned Economy system". The increase on quality of children could never be compensated by the loss of huge population potentials.


Gary Becker (1994) pointed out society could save across generations by the birth of many children. Particularly, the between-generation return to  human capital investment is much higher than physical capital if the education system is well-functioned. The economic growth is majorly driven by the between generation human capital accumulation. As a result, more children under a well-functioned education system could contribute greatly to the long-term economic growth. By comparison, the short-term economics growth is majorly driven by the within-generation TFP increase. (JY Lin, R Ren 2007, J Huang, JY Lin, S Rozelle 1999 ,L Yuhong, W Hao, Z Yuxin 2008)


James Liang (2012) conducted very important research between the entrepreneurship and population structure. As a successful Nasdaq-listed high-tech company founder, a billionaire and an active top-economics-journal publisher,  he concludes that the social ladder for younger will vanish gradually under a low fertility rate and inversed-triangle population pyramid.  This is particularly observed in Japan (K Christensen, G Doblhammer, R Rau 2009, N Ogawa, A Mason, A Chawla, R Matsukura 2009, LJ Schoppa, 2001) under Japanese reluctant policy-reforming system. On the contrary, the younger generation of India and United States could quickly accumulate adequate human capital to pave the way for business success thanks to the percentage of old cohort being very small (the population pyramid of USA and India are triangle-shaped). Sillicon Valley, for instance, has witnessed (AL Saxenian 2005) the booming of Indian-originated entrepreneurs. The head leader of Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Cisco are all Indian originated and meanwhile first generation Indian Americans have occupied almost half of the Vice President level positions in FLAG (Facebook, Linkedin, Amazon, Google).




The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we tend to build a three-period overlapping generation model to depict the dynamic optimal path between the choice of raising more kids, involving in a start-up business or working for paycheck. The transitional process will be discussed specifically under different preference assumptions.  The influence on the economy under low fertility condition will be demonstrated.  In section 3 we describe the benchmark empirical model and the data set. The statistical relationship between the low fertility and the economics growth rate, inequality and innovation level will be displayed. Also, we focus on inflation and unemployment issue to depict the impact of low fertility rate more specifically. In section 4 we conduct three types of robustness check and discuss the empirical result in detailed pattern. Section 5 concludes the whole paper and gives future policy suggestions.

\subsection{Theoretical Approach}

\subsubsection{OLG Model Setup}

Following Isaac Ehrlich and Jinyoung Kim (2007) pattern, we consider a three period overlapping generation mode in a economy with a representative agent. The represented agent's total utility depends on his consumption. In this article we suppose the agent lives through childhood, adult and the elder age. All the production are produced by people who are  adulthood currently. We assume no government involvement in our model. As a result, we can never use fiscal policy to collect tax revenue from each family and redistribute to the society in a certain form.

In the childhood, young kids live completely on their parents. In the model,  denote $y_t$ as the to total output of each parent. Each parent spends $\theta_t/2$ of their individual output to raise their kids. (So altogether mom and dad spend $\theta_t$ of their individual output.) As a result one kid can consume $y_t \theta_t$ during his childhood life. $C_{1,t}$ is used to represent childhood consumption when the agent is a child in period t. 


Then the represent agent grows up from childhood to adulthood. We suppose a survival rate $\pi_1$, which means the representative agent has a chance of $1-\pi_1$ that he cannot survive the childhood age. Here we make the general assumption that $0<\pi_1<1$. The representative agent chooses whether to make a new business (e.g. a start-up company) or work normally as an employee for paycheck compensation. 
 If the producer decides to make a start-up he/she will lose the opportunity chance to receive biweekly paycheck, a source of steady income. We assume the new business level (entrepreneurship) has a non-negative effect on the production efficiency (paycheck wage ratio). With different social aggregate production level, the innovation level and entrepreneurship exhibit increasing marginal production efficiency effect under larger aggregate output level.  Also during adulthood life the agent needs to decide how many offspring to raise. The reason of having children is quite natural since human being, as a species of mammal, wishes to make the gene live forever by raising kids. In our model, we assume during pregnancy and lactation period, the represented agent cannot work or start a new business to increase their utility level. During this period, parents have to devote themselves thoroughly in  the
 birth to a new life. In the model I make a reasonable assumption that an adult can only breed children during adulthood time. 

During the adulthood life, besides an investment in raising kid, the representative agent also need to pay their parents pension expenses as there is no government involvement in this model. That is to say, if parents of the agent are still alive, there should exist a portion deduction of the total output of this Representative agent to raise  parents since parents in their elder age are retired and do not make further production. 

There is a probably $\pi_2$ that an adulthood can survive to his/her old age. It is quite similar to $\pi_1$ case that we may assume $0<\pi_2<1$ and make it exogenous. When a person becomes older he/she stops working and lives only on his/her pension from  their children. In this particular model the pension is collected from the next generation of the family. Parents raise kids when they are young and lives on their grown-up children when older and becomes no longer suitable for work.



A young parent chooses to maximize his/her lifetime utility as follows:
\be 
U=[\f{1}{1-\sigma}][C_{1,t}^{1-\sigma}-1]+\beta \pi_1 [ \f{1}{1-\sigma}] [ C_{2,t+1}^{1-\sigma}-1]+\beta^2 \pi_1 \pi_2 [\f{1}{1-\sigma}] [C_{3,t+2}^{1-\sigma}-1] \label{E1}
\ee
subject to 
\be
C_{1,t}=\theta_t y_t  \label{E2}
\ee
\be
y_t=A_t l_t+A_b b_t  \label{E3}
\ee
\be
m n_{t+1}\leq L_1  \label {E4}
\ee
\be
b_{t+1}+m n_{t+1}+l_{t+1}\leq L_2 \label {E5}
\ee
\be 
\pi_1=\pi_1(Y_t)   \label {E6}
\ee
\be
\pi_2=\pi_2(Y_t)  \label {E7}
\ee
\be
B_t=\sum_{k=1}^{N_t} b_k  \label {E8}
\ee
\be
Y_t=N_t y_t   \label {E9}
\ee
\be
C_{2,t+1}=f_{t+1} w_{t+1} l_{t+1}  \label {E10}
\ee
\be
f_{t+1}=1- \f{1}{2} n_{t+1}  \theta_{t+1}-\pi_2 x_{t+1}    \label {E11}
\ee
\be
C_{3,t+2}=\f{1}{2}  \pi_1 x_{t+2}  n_{t+1} C_{2,t+2}   \label {E12}
\ee
\be    A_t=A B_t^\alpha=A (\sum_{k=1}^{N_t} b_k) ^\alpha    \label {E13} \ee
\be    A_b= p_t A B_t^\gamma=p_t A (\sum_{k=1}^{N_t} b_k) ^\gamma \label{E14} \ee



The choice variables here are $\{n_t\}_{t=0}^\infty$,$\{\theta_t\}_{t=0}^\infty$,$\{x_t\}_{t=0}^\infty$, $\{b_t\}_{t=0}^\infty$, $\{l_t \}_{t=0}^\infty$
\\

Since the wage rate are competitively determined we have
\be
w_t=\f{\partial}{\partial{l_t}} y_t= \f{\partial}{\partial{l_t}} [ A B_t^\alpha l_t]=A B_t^\alpha \label {E15}
\ee

In the expression (\ref{E1}), we assume a constant relative risk aversion utility function with respect to consumption in different periods. $\beta$ denotes the time preference. We makes no assumption on $\beta$. A representative agent might have $\beta>1$ just because he/she is more concerned with consumption in old age while in some other cases he/she may have $\beta<1$ since childhood life is the most important period in this case. % $\tilde{C}_{2,t+1} (e_{t+1})$ specifies the reputation gain.

In equation (\ref{E2}), $\theta_t$ is the portion of parent's income spending on each kid. In out notation, $C_{1,t}=\theta_t y_t$ is the total consumption in the agent's childhood life. The agent can only live on his/her parents' income when he/she is in the young age. 

In equation (\ref{E3}), $l_t$ is the total time the representative producer chooses to work for paycheck. $b_t$ denotes the total time the agent chooses to work for a new business (for example: a start-up high-tech company which is risky). $A_t$ is the marginal return on work while $A_b$ represents the marginal return on a start-up company. $A_t$ and $A_b$ are defined and their economic meaning are discussed in equation (\ref{E13}) and equation (\ref{E14}). Total outputs depends only on the return on regular work sector and innovative start-up sector. In this case, $b_t$ could be treated as venture capital which is definitely more risky. There are no cross-generation physical capital accumulation in this model.


In constraint (\ref{E4}), $L_1$ denotes the maximum year that a consumer can breed off-springs (usually approximately 15 years) and $n_t$ is the number of children(i.e. the fertility rate). Here $m$ is the parameter representing pregnancy and breed length of a single child. This parameter is obviously longer than 10 months but in more general cases it can be a period of one and a half to two years since a person must devote almost all his/her time and energy to the baby when the child is very young. It is well known that woman can hardly give birth to a child above a certain age. This is the most pivotal point in this inequality constraint and we will see it plays an important role in the fertility rate decision making process. Also, $m$ is the minimum years gap between two children.

In constraint (\ref{E5}), $L_2$ denotes the length of adulthood life.  The producer chooses during his adulthood how to separate his/her time into going for new business, raising kids and working for outputs. It is quite obvious the inequality constraint will become an equality constraints when doing optimization. The reason is that if the constraint is slack the agent can always increase the production time to increase his second period's utility level. Certainly we have $L_2>L_1$.

Through equations (\ref{E6}) and (\ref{E7}), two parameters $\pi_1$, $\pi_2$ are introduced, where $\pi_1$ is the survival rate from childhood to adult,$\pi_2$ defines the rate the agent has the luck to retire. These two parameter are supposed to be exogenous. In that case, it is assumed the surviving rates depend on the aggregate social output level . It shall be seriously taken into account  the importance of the rapid change of new business contribution to the whole society  that leads to the great improvement of production efficiency.

In equation (\ref{E8}) and (\ref{E9}). The social aggregate  new business level $B_t$ is the aggregate of individual new business input level $\sum b_t$.  $N_t$ defines total population of a generation and $Y_t$ represents social aggregate output level.

In equation (\ref{E10}) and (\ref{E11}), $C_{2,t+1}$ is the consumption of an adult in period $t+1$. In this three-period overlapping generation model we assume that the total consumption is a fraction of output. Each adult has to spend $\f{1}{2}\theta_t$ of total output to raise each single child.  In the model $x_t$ denotes the proportion that the consumer will give the output to parents if they are still alive. The expectation of such proportion is $\pi_2 x_t$. As no government is included in this model, it ensures the agent will have the basic necessities of life when having no ability to work anymore by receiving money from their children.

In equation (\ref{E12}), $C_{3,t+2}$ defines the consumption of an old person in period $t+2$. According to the previous explanation, the component of $C_{3,t+2}$ depends on the transferring payments from off-springs. The expected value of this part of consumption is the product of survival rate of the children, the number of kids, the output each child will transfer.

In equation (\ref{E13}), we make a crucial assumption that marginal return on work depends on the social aggregate venture capita level $B_t$. That is to say, we believe new business contribute so much and provide positive externality to the productivity rate. Here $\alpha$ and $A$ are constant.

In equation (\ref{E14}), we assume $p_t$ is the probability of running a start-up successfully and $1-p_t$ is the failure probability. Usually speaking, $p_t$ should be quite small (the succeed rate in US could be less than 10 \% while in China it could be even less than 5 \%) It should be expected that $p_t < 0.1$. We may assume
 \be p_t=p(Y_t) \f{N_t}{N_t+N_{t-1}} \ee 

where $p(Y_t)$ is a constant with $p'()=\epsilon>0$(very small but positive) and $ \f{N_t}{N_t+N_{t-1}}$ is percentage of the younger cohort it time $t$. We believe the success probability coefficient $p$ should increase with diminishing transaction cost under the economic development. Also, with more younger generation percentage, younger generation could have a higher chance to acquire a senior position to accumulate adequate human capital to pave the way for start-up success. (James Liang 2012) 
The total marginal return from a new business is defined as:
\be
A_b=\underbrace{p_t}_{Prob. \ of \  success} \underbrace{A B_t^\gamma}_{return\  from \ success}+\underbrace{(1-p_t)}_{Prob. \ of \  failure} \underbrace{0}_{return\  from \ failure}
\ee




Obviously we should have $\gamma>>\alpha$ where $0<\alpha<\gamma<1$, which is the incentive of successful business. Usually the return from seed stock and option bonus for a successful business should be more than  3000 \% of the salary compensation from the data of US stock market.

When we eliminate $\{b_t\}_{t=0}^\infty$ we have to solve the following problem:
\be
\begin{split}
\max_{\{n_t , \theta_t, x_t, l_t\}_{t=0}^\infty}  U &=[\f{1}{1-\sigma}] \{ [\theta_t(A_t l_t+A_b(L_2-l_t-m n_t)]^{1-\sigma}-1   \} \\ 
 &+ \beta \pi_1 \f{1}{1-\sigma} \{ [(A_t l_t +A_b (L_2-l_t- m n_t))(1-\f{1}{2}n_t \theta_{t+1} -\pi_2 x_{t+1})]^{1-\sigma} -1   \}  \\
&\beta^2 \pi_1 \pi_2 \{ [\f{1}{2} x_{t+2} \pi_1 n_{t+1} (A_t l_t +A_b(L_2-l_t-m n_t)) ]^{1-\sigma} -1 \}
\end{split}
\ee

For the purpose of simplicity and solubility,  we assume no savings and government participation in our framework. Relaxing the savings assumption, especially allowing parents to borrow money in the second period would, could potentially increase the budget constraints to spend on child-bearing and education. Under the case of limited financial borrowing capacity, government should increase the subsidy for young adults to help raise more kids with sufficient budgets, actively supplementing the incomplete credit market. Government intervention is particularly important for those non-immigrant countries, as they have to boost the fertility rate without external foreign immigrants.

 \end{subsection}

\subsubsection {The equilibrium path and economic explanation}

We assume that parents expect the proportion of children transfer payments $E(x_{t+2})$ is their own transfer payments proportion to the previous generation $x_{t+1}$. In this case, $x$ is not necessarily to be 0 at the equilibrium. 

Let the aggregate new business(venture) capital to output ratio in $t$ as $q_t$ and denote $\tilde{L_2}=L_2-m n_t$.\\ 
\textbf{Proposition 1.} With a fixed start-up succeed coefficient $p$ fixed, at the equilibrium we should have $q_t$ exist uniquely and $\f{\p q}{\p p}>0$. That is to say the increasing chance of new business success increases the proportion of new business investment.\\

Proofs of all propositions are provided at the end of this chapter

\textbf{Proposition 2.} With the increase of $\gamma$, $q$ will increase.  \\
\textbf{Proof.} It could be directly obtained from equation (\ref{*}). \qed\\
\textbf{Remark.} $p$ and $\gamma$ is the incentive for getting more revenue from successfully building a new business. So increasing the benefit or chance from success will increase the attempt for high return.  \\
\textbf{Proposition 3.} The new business/total output ratio $q$ will increase with current fertility $n_t$ decreases and last period fertility $n_{t-1}$ increases.\\

\textbf{Remark.} This proposition shows the dynamic effect of the fertility rate on innovation trial. Current child born will exert negative influence on current period innovation since the representative individual have to divide more time to take care of the children as equation (\ref{5}) states. However, the new born baby boomers will encourage the innovation trials (increase $q$) in the next generation because these babies become adults in the next period, which could enhance aggregate output level and consequently increases in the marginal benefit of a successful start-up company.
In this case, more people tend to enter the high-risky innovative sector to win a potential high payoff under a larger incentive. The dynamic effect of fertility rate is the central topic in the paper so that this proposition is really important for further derivation and discussion.\\
\textbf{Proposition 4.} If the preference for next generation $\beta$ is high enough, which indicates that the representative agent cares a lot for the future. Then the optimal fertility path will be as follows.
\be  n^*=\f{L_1}{m} \ee

\textbf{Remark.}  \\
\textbf{Proposition 4.} is just what we observed around the world in middle age or in some African countries nowadays. The aggregate economics development level is significantly low. Under the poor medical treatment and the consequently high death rate, human beings have to raise as many children as they can to proliferate. If mankind choose low feriltiy rate at that time, we human beings might have been distinct and could no longer have survived till today. But the child-bearing period has the maximum length of $L_1$ so that there exists a upper limit bound of the fertility rate. This proposition clarifies an individual keeps giving birth to new babies without interval when they are at child-bearing period before the industrial revolution when the time preference factor is significantly high. $\beta$, in a certain extent, defines human being's altruism for next generation. Before the industrial revolution, such altruism is so high that the population of human beings could keep growing, having a chance embrace the sunrise of technology rapid growth after-coming.  If human being could not survive until modern day when marginal revenue from new business is high enough to generate technology and TFP growth, it is meaningless for us to talk about the infinite-period utility maximization model.  \\

\textbf{Proposition 5.}  When \textbf{Proposition 4.} holds, the number of the live adults grows at a rate of $g^{max}=\f{\pi_1 L_1}{2m}-1$ for each generation. Denote $N_t$ as the living adult population in period $t$. It is clearly that $N_t=(1+g^{max}) N_{t-1}=(\f{\pi_1 L_1}{2m}-1)N_{t-1}$. $P_t$ is used to calculate the total population in period $t$. The population is calculated as follows:
\be
\begin{split}
 P_t &=\f{n_t}{2} N_t+ N_t+ \pi_2 N_{t-1}\\
        &=(\f{L_1}{2 m}+1 +\f{\pi_2}{\f{\pi_1 L_1}{2 m}-1})N_t
\end{split}
\ee
Also
\be
 P_{t+1} =(\f{L_1}{2 m}+1 +\f{\pi_2}{\f{\pi_1 L_1}{2 m}-1})N_{t+1}=(\f{L_1}{2 m}+1 +\f{\pi_2}{\f{\pi_1 L_1}{2 m}-1})(1+g^{max})N_t=(1+g^{max})P_t
\ee
The growth rate of total population between periods is $\f{\pi_1 L_1}{2m}-1$. \qed \\

\textbf{Proposition 6.} When \textbf{Proposition 4.} holds, in our three-period overlapping generation model, there is very limited output per capita growth before the aggregate output level $Y_t$ big enough. The total aggregate output $Y_t$ level grows at approximate constant rate $g^{max}$ because of the constant population growth. 
\be  Y_{t+1}=N_{t+1} y_{t+1}=(1+g^{max}) N_t y_t=(1+g^{max}) Y_t  \ee
 \qed\\




\textbf{Proposition 7.} With the survival rate $\pi_1$ large enough or the preference for next generate $\beta$ small enough, the optimal number of off-springs will begin to decrease.\\

\textbf{Remark.} There are also trade off between the starting new business rate $q$ and giving birth to next generation. When $q$ continues to increase, a higher percentage of people tend to have less kids in order to gain enough energy to make a start-up business. This is what we observed from Japan's case 40 years ago and from China's case 20 years ago. However, $q$ cannot continue to growth forever since it becomes harder to succeed in new business when the proportion of younger generation continues to  shrink, which is the following.\\
\textbf{Proposition 8.} The $q$ could not continue to increase when fertility rate continue to decrease quickly.\\

\textbf{Remark.} When more people tend to select to have less kids in exchange for more innovation attempt, they shrink the younger cohorts' population and consequently decreases the opportunity of next generation's new business success ratio. This is because in an older-cohort-dominate society, younger generation could not gain adequate human capital for succeeding in startup business since most important positions have already been occupied by older-cohort. Younger cohort could be promoted very slowly in an aging (low fertility) society. As a result, he/she could not gain enough customer resources, management skills and experience to start up his own business very successfully. That is to say, sacrificing the quantity of off-springs in exchange for new business investment might decrease the new business investment opportunity for the next generation.  This lead to the following result.\\
\textbf{Proposition 9.} A dynamic equilibrium exists in this model.\\


The fertility and innovation pattern should be displayed as the following process. First, the fertility rate is really high and innovation interest grows very slowly. Then with steady innovation (new business) success probability increasing, people tend to reduce the fertility rate and investment in "start-up" business, which contribute to giant economic growth. When the fertility rate becomes significantly lower, the incentive for innovation investment becomes lower and fewer people are willing to make a "start-up" business, which will ruin the economic growth pattern and cause economic stagnation. Finally when the winning chance in "venture capital gambling"  becomes very lower and people tend to have more off-springs at that moment, which would lead to the increasing chance for next generation. There will be fluctuation when this model reaches the final equilibrium. 

We can conclude from this theoretical overlapping generation model that the low fertility rate is really harmful for long-term economic growth. The short-term effect of low fertility rate could be positive since the raising cost are reduced. The innovation path are discussed very detailed in the above-mentioned nine propositions. The inequality level, therefore, could be ambiguous since there should be expected large income dispersion in a innovation-driven economy while the income dispersion could be reduced under economy stagnation and innovation stagnation. However, it remains an open question whether we could treat the income difference between a successful innovation payoff and a regular paycheck as inequality. The marginal contribution of an innovation could be more worthy than the innovation payoff to the entrepreneur. In other word, these successful "founders of new business" deserve even more than what they receive from the stock market.


\subsection{Empirical Setup and Result}

\subsubsection{Data and Methodology}
After the theoretical work, in this section we would like to use the empirical approach to test whether our prediction is correct or not. I just collect the macro-level data from the world bank online data set. All the data are from 1960 to current year (2015) though only few countries supply the estimated data of 2015. There are altogether 215 countries or political entities we collect from the data set and the rest 34 are summarized region  statistical information. All the data are annual data since most developing and undeveloped countries could not provide more specific data.  We have collected most of the available indicators depicting the economics growth level, innovation and inequality level.  

We use aggregate fertility level, population percentile among different age to describe the population structure and wish to examine the influence of those independent variables on the real economics growth, innovation level and inequality. It unveils the relationship between the innovation level, inequality and distorted (inverted-triangle-shaped population pyramid) population structure, which is the most crucial contribution of this empirical research  that have not yet been discussed specifically in the existing literature.

Naturally, the first step is to explore how distorted population structure affect economics growth rate. We run the following regression.
\be 
GDPg^k_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 lf_{90}^k +\beta_2 elf_{90}^k+\beta_3 {lf}_t^k+\beta_4 {elf}_t^k+\beta_5 f_t^k+\Gamma X+e_t^k
\ee
where: \\
$GDPg_t^k$ is the GDP growth rate of  country $k$ in year $t$; \\
$lf_{90}^k$ is the indicating variable ($lf_{90}^k \in \{ 0, 1\}$) which shows whether country $k$ belongs to low fertility country in the year 1990 (if fertility  of country $k$ is less than 1.85 in 1990 then $lf_{90}^k=1$ otherwise $lf_{90}^k=0$); \\
$elf_{90}^k$ is the indicating variable ($elf_{90}^k \in \{ 0, 1\}$) which shows whether country $k$ belongs to extreme low fertility country in the year 1990 (if fertility  of country $k$ is less than 1.35 in 1990 then $elf_{90}^k=1$ otherwise $elf_{90}^k=0$); \\
$lf_t^k$ is the indicating variable ($I_{lf}^k \in \{ 0, 1\}$) which shows whether country $k$ belongs to low fertility country in the year t (if fertility  of country $k$ is less than 1.85 in year t then $I_{lf}^k=1$ otherwise $I_{lf}^k=0$); \\
$elf_t^k$ shows the indicating variable ($elf_t^k \in \{ 0, 1\}$) which shows whether country $k$ belongs to extreme low fertility country in the year t (if fertility  of country $k$ is less than 1.35 in year t then $I_{elf}^k=1$ otherwise $elf_t^k=0$); \\
$f_t^k$ represents the fertility level in the year $t$ of country $k$. \\
$X$ are vectors that control other independent variables that influence the economics growth rate such as region belongings and foreign direct investment.

\subsubsection{The effect on economics growth}
We summarize the empirical result in the following table. We cluster the data in countries/economics entities level. In column (1) and (2) we run the regression by using data from all 215 countries; in column (3) and (4) only major countries (OECD countries and some important emerging economics entities) are taken into account while in column (5) and (6) only OECD countries results are reported. At the same time, we also summarize the result using different time interval. It could be expected we should focus on the impact of more recent years. The main reason is that the data 20 years ago could be incomplete and the measuring methods those emerging countries use could be less convincing before the invention of modern information industry booming and further globalization. In column (1), (3), (5) we use all year data (1966 to 2015) while in column (2), (4), (6) we only report the more recent panel data (1996 to 2015), discussing the impact on the growth rate in the past two decades. The robust standard errors after clustering are generated to calculate p-values.

An obvious question is why we select fertility rate of year 1990 as the low fertility indicator. Firstly, the year 1990 could be regarded as the beginning of modern low-fertility research. Before that most scholars and international organization never considered that the world could experience severe low-fertility  problem in the future. A lot of open report (United Nations Population Fund 1985, Ford foundations 1980) predicts the world would experience sharp population increase in the mid $21^{st}$ century. They argue Chinese population will reach 3 billion and Indian population would go to 2.5 billion in 2050 and conclude there will be a disaster. Also, in the late 1980s and early 1990s many scholars in the United States were contemplating seriously that the GDP of Japan would exceed USA at the end of $20^{th}$ century. 
Currently, the former chief economist of World Bank Justin Y. Lin (2012) and Committee member of People Bank's of China Daokui Li(2008) predicted that China's GDP growth rate will maintain at $8 \%$ level in the next 30 years and the GDP will be $3 \sim 4$ times as United States in 2050. Justin Lin (2012) made such prediction according to the past experience of Japan and Korea. He claimed those countries could maintain $8\%$ GDP growth rate for another 30 years after GDP per capita had reached one-sixth of the United States' and consequently China would repeat the same procedure. However, the fatal weakness of above-mentioned conclusions are they fail to even take a look at the drastic population structure change and extreme low fertility of those countries (China 1.18, Japan 1.4, South Korea 1.30 in 2012), which would exert dominant influence on future economics growth.  They overestimated the population in a great extent.  In the recent 25 years many scholars (Makoto 2001, N Ogawa, A Mason, A Chawla, R Matsukura, 2009, RR Rindfuss, KB Guzzo, SP Morgan .2003) accomplished important research on the topic of low fertility rate. As a result, we select fertility rate of the year 1990 as a pivotal index to depict future age structure. Secondly,  our research data are from 1966 to 2015 while the year 1990 is exactly the midpoint. Also, it is exactly 25 years from 1990 to now, which could be considered as the length of one generation. 

The following two Propositions are obvious and easy to prove.\\
\textbf{Proposition A.} If the fertility is $\alpha$, then the population of each generation  will increase by $\f{\alpha}{2}$ assuming all children stay alive. If we consider the possibility of childhood death, the increasing ratio will be adjusted to  $\f{\alpha}{2.1}$.\\
\textbf{Proposition B.} If the the fertility is $\alpha$ ($\alpha<2$). It would take $\f{25 \ln 0.5}{\log \alpha-\log 2.1}$ years to decrease the population by $50\%$ without considering any internal or external migration.\\
According to \textbf{Proposition B.}, it would take 137 years for a country to shrink to half size if the long-term fertility rate is 1.86 and take only 40 years for a country under 1.35 long-term fertility rate. Consequently, the population outlook of east Asian countries could be very pessimistic.

From Table \ref{1}, we will see the low fertility  indicators of 1990 have significant negative effect on GDP growth rate in 5 of 6 models. Interestingly, we find the those countries where experienced extreme low fertility contributed statistically positively on growth rate. This is mainly because the those extreme low fertility countries are from Asia and contributed most part of economics growth during these period (the coefficients of Asia are significantly positive).

It seems beyond expectation low fertility could contribute negatively to aggregate GDP growth rate since there will be fewer total GDP under fewer population.  However, traditional economics model (Solow 1957, Romer 1986) predicts higher GDP per capita with less population. In order to test for this hypothesis, we use GDP per capita growth rate as dependent variable and report the following empirical results.

Generally speaking, low fertility contributes significantly negatively (95 $\%$ confidence level) to GDP per capita growth rate, which contradicts traditional economics growth rate. At the same time, we could not ignore that the influence of current extreme low fertility rate contributes positively to GDP per capita growth. This could be explained that people tend to be beneficial from reducing cost of raising kids right now. It reminds us that the current fertility could exert a delayed effect on economics indicators.  



We define economics stagnation indicator by using following formula.
\be  I_{stagnation}=1 \ee if GDP per capita in 2014 $< 1.1*$ GDP per capita in 1994.
Otherwise  \be  I_{stagnation}=0 \ee We use Logit model, Probit model and Linear Probability Model to test the influence on economic stagnation.

All models predict the probability of getting stuck in economic stagnation is higher under low fertility rate and extreme low fertility rate, which give us the same result with previous general model approach.

\subsubsection{The effect on inequality level}


Also, we are interested in the low-fertility effect on inequality level. We use estimated GINI index to depict the inequality level and report the result.

The impact on inequality level is ambiguous. Some coefficients are significantly positive and others are negative. We could notice that region influence dominates the fertility impact. For example, Latin America and Asian dummies contribute positive effect on GINI index while Europe dummy is negative. We can conclude that low-fertility influence are less important than region difference when we discuss the economics inequality level. Another possible explanation is that GINI index tend to estimate the difference between the rich and the poor while low-fertility would only have effect on between generation income difference. That is to say, it should have effect on the income inequality between the old and young but not between the rich and the poor. It deserves valuable future research.



\subsubsection {The effect on innovation level}


Innovation is another important factor we should have an eye on in this section. We use high-technology export ratios, new business per capita and time to new business as regressands to conclude the impact on innovation.

Table \ref{4} to table \ref{6}  provide us first-hand result on innovation level. We find that both low-fertility index in the year 1990 and low-fertility itself exert negative influence on export ratios and new business per capita ratios. The results listed in Table \ref{4} and Table \ref{5} supply solid support on the negative effect of low fertility rate on innovation level and economics vitality. In Table \ref{4} we will find that past low fertility indicators have significant negative impact on high-tech output while current low fertility indicators in Table \ref{5} have significantly negative impact on new business per capita.  It reminds us the low-fertility could have different time-variant impact on different aspect of social innovation. In Table \ref{6}, time to new business could be considered as difficulty level of initiate a start-up or in a certain extent should be treated as difficulty to innovation.
Interestingly, in Table \ref{6} we find that current low-fertility could have raise such  difficulty while past low-fertility could reduce it. Again, it gives us strong hint we have to treat the low-fertility effect in a longer time period and focus on  the long-term dynamic effects. 

Now we define the innovation stagnation dummy under the following formula.
\be I_{innovation \ stagnation}=1 \ee if new business per capita in 2014 $<1.2*$ new business per capita in 1994.
Otherwise \be I_{innovation\  stagnation}=0 \ee

We use Logit model, Probit model and Linear Probability Model to test the influence
on innovation stagnation.

All three models show the probability of getting stagnant in innovation is increasing under low fertility rate while the probability is decreasing under extreme low fertility. The first part result is not surprisingly while the second part result is beyond further investigation with more specific micro level data.

\begin{subsection} {The effect on other important factors}


Generally OLG model predicts aging economy would increase tax ratio to support its pension system. No matter whether the pension system is Pay-as-you-go or fully-funded, the essence is to use next generation's work to support the old one. It could be expected with fewer next generation under low fertility, the tax ratio should increase. In the next table we test the effect on tax ratio over the GDP.

Even theoretical part does not depict the government's transfer payment. We are still interested the impact of low fertility on the tax rate.


Not surprisingly, past extreme low fertility leads to increasing tax rate, particularly in OECD countries. At the same time, the influence of current low fertility rate on tax ratio is negative. This could be explained by past low fertility rate could lead to current high dependency ratio, which directly impacts the tax collected in the pension and medical welfare system.  On the contrary, current low fertility rate could cut the cost of government transferred expenditure on childcare. Consequently the coefficients in column (1) and (2) are statistically negative. Generally speaking, the pension expenditure expense increase outweighs the childcare expense decrease so that the long-term overall effect on tax ratio is positive, which is shown in the row (5), particularly in OECD countries.

Table \ref{8} and Table \ref{9} report the effect of low fertility on long-term unemployment rate on overall population group and  female group respectively. We conclude that low-fertility rate have long-term negative effect on employment, particularly on female cohort. This result is quite counter-intuitive since it is generally believed that a female person is more able to find a job if her expected fertility rate is low. This result provides us hint that low fertility may increase job participating ratio of female and increase the female labor supply. Therefore, the long-term effect on female unemployment rate is positive.

Table \ref{8} and Table \ref{9} discuss the impact on unemployment rate. The long-run Philips Curve predicts that unemployment rate has no relationship with inflation rate while short-run Philips Curve predicts that those two variables are negatively correlated. Under Table \ref{10} the impact of low fertility on inflation rate is examined.

We find the influence on inflation rate is ambiguous. Some coefficients before low-fertility dummies are positive while others are negative. Most coefficients are not statistically significant. 



\subsection{Robustness Check and Discussion}

\subsubsection{Considering a more accurate definition of fertility rate}
}
Our definition of fertility rate is the actually total fertility rate among all population group. But in personal 
selection part only adult people make rational choice between "producing" more next generation, or supplying more labor work or going for a start-up.
In this case, the teenagers who are not old enough to enter the market should not be considered into the model. In other word, the adolescent fertility rate should be subtracted from the total fertility rate to make the depiction more precise. We revise our data set by the following formula.\\
\begin{centering}
 \textbf{adjusted-fertility rate=total fertility rate- adolescent fertility rate(births per 1000 women ages 15-19)/1000}
\end{centering}\\ \\
We use the re-calibrated fertility data to re-estimate our model. The following three tables show the difference between our original estimation and new estimation. (First table is the re-estimation of the effect on GDP per capita growth rate; the second table is on GINI index ; the third table is on new business per capita)

From Table \ref{A1}, Table \ref{A2} and Table \ref{A3}, we can see clearly that the t statistics become smaller. But most of the difference are minor so that
our conclusion made won't be changed in the previous section. 

\begin{subsection}{Considering economic cycling influence}
In this section we wish to take into account the economic cycling influence on the variables to re-estimate the model, which 
is a kind of robustness test. I have particular interest to check if low fertility rate hurts the economics indicators during recessions.

We find that US experience economics recession during 1970-1971, 1974-1975, 1980-1983, 1990-1991, 2001-2002, 2008-2009.
We use US economic downturn as an index to depict global economics condition. We re-estimate our model during the non-recession period and
recession period separately to see the difference with our original results. 

The following three tables show the difference between our original estimation and new estimation. (First table is the re-estimation of the effect on GDP per capita growth rate; the second table is on GINI index ; the third table is on new business per capita)

From Table \ref{B1}, Table \ref{B2} and Table \ref{B3}, we find that the impact of low-fertility rate during non-recession period become less significant while 
those impact become more significant during recession period. In other word, the low-fertility effect will move onto a more influencing stage when the global economics condition are not very good. The robustness check I finish here leaves an open door for future more valuable research.

\subsubsection{Re-estimating the effect on inflation by using a Probit model approach
}
In the previous section we conclude that the low-fertility effect on inflation is ambiguous. In this section we would like to separate the inflation index into
different categories and reestimate the effect.

The inflation status could be divided into four different categories: 
\\(1) deflation: with inflation $< 0\%$ 
\\(2) low inflation: with inflation $\in [0\%, 3\%]$ 
\\(3) moderate inflation with inflation $\in [3\%, 10\%]$ 
\\(4) high inflation with inflation $> 10 \%$ 

Table \ref{C1}  to Table \ref{C4} reports the Probit estimation of the low-fertility effect on the probability of having deflation, low inflation , moderate inflation and high inflation respectively.

By dividing the inflation into four different categories, we can conclude low-fertility rate will reduce the chance of becoming deflation or 
high inflation. Meanwhile, it can increase the probability of entering low inflation range quite significantly, particularly if we use more recent data.
Perhaps this is the result of oil rocketing in the 1980s which are not taken into account if we use more recent data.
The effect on entering moderate inflation range is somehow ambiguous. Low fertility could decrease the chance of entering moderate inflation range while extreme low fertility increase. We conclude that the low fertility does decrease the volatility of inflation range by reducing the chance of entering deflation or high inflation range. Most countries with low fertility rate and extreme low fertility rate enjoy low or moderate inflation, which definitely is a good news for economic stability.

\subsection{Concluding Remarks}

Recent studies  show low-fertility rate has a long-term negative effect on economics growth, particularly by studying the case of Japan and European countries (K Christensen, G Doblhammer, R Rau, JW Vaupel, 2009). Most literature would argue low fertility rate would damage economics growth in the long run because of the insufficient labor supply and demand. The main contribution of this paper is that it first unveils the fact low fertility rate would provide negative incentive to innovation and venture capital attempt in the long run, which could discourage the entrepreneurship and new invention across generation. Taking Japan as an example, thanks to the baby boomer policy after the Second World War, when these baby boomers entered the job market in the 1970s, there were a lot of innovative new business during that period. People were willing to attempt high-risky start-ups and  new techniques in a younger-cohort-dominant society, which paved the way for Japan‘s economic take-off during that period. However, when the fertility rate becomes extremely low and the whole economy is dominated by the old cohort, younger people could not gain enough human capital to win  risky pioneering business gambling, which leads to fewer innovation after 1990s. We can see the fact that all the world-famous companies in Japan are still those companies that have already gained their reputation thirties years ago. The "lost 20 years of Japan" is mainly because they gave too little birth to the next generation 40 years ago that wiped out the innovation potential for the next generation. People could not accuse the younger cohort don't work hard nowadays to catch up their American peers. Actually younger workers in Japan work much more diligent than their American peers but having inadequate human capital to make start-ups like Google, Facebook and Tesla. The picture was the situation for Japan for the last twenty years and is the case for South Korean currently and will be the situation of China in the future, where these three countries are all suffering from extremely low fertility rate dilemma but on different stage.

We conclude this paper by claiming that low fertility rate would not only reduce the GDP growth rate but also the GDP per capital rate in the long run, which is on the opposite side of general belief that lowing population could enhance the per capita growth rate. It is mainly because younger cohort could have little chance to win pioneer business gambling in the aging economy. There will be little innovation and new business in the long run. In contrast of general belief, our empirical result shows low fertility will increase long-term female unemployment rate, which indicates there should not be so many female workers participating the labor market. The volatility of interest rate and inequality rate could be reduced, which could be potential evidence of stagnant economics phenomenon. All the countries suffering from the low fertility should encourage giving birth to more off-springs by providing enough subsidies. Also, this paper gives us hint the government should never let the society dominated by the old cohort. An executable plan is Singapore's mode to reduce the old cohort's retirement pension, welfare and lower the decision power of the old cohort. Younger generation should have more chance to be in the high-ranking position, accumulating human capital for new innovation and new business, which is the long term engine of economics booming. Also, it is very important for female to give adequate birth to the next generation, which, in a certain extent, more crucial than how many work they contribute at this moment. Just as what Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore told a female Ph.D. student is the year 2009 . "\textit{You should find a husband and give birth to next generation before 30. That is more important than your Ph.D. degree.}", the low fertility problem is the fatal reason for long term economic stagnation. An open topic is how we can get rid of the low fertility dilemma and it deserves future work, particularly in Asian countries.

\subsection{Appendix}
\textbf{Proof of Proposition 1}\\
Notice under the definition of $q_t$ we have
\be B_t=\sum_{k=1}^{N_t} b_k=qN_t (L_2-m n_t) =q N_t \tilde{L_2} \ee
We should maximize equation (\ref{3}) by choose $q$:
\be \max_q  A(q N_t \tilde{L_2})^\alpha (1-q) \tilde{L_2}+pA [q N_t \tilde{L_2}]^\gamma q \tilde{L_2}  \ee
which is equivalent to 
\be \max_q q^{\alpha} (N_t \tilde{L_2})^{\alpha-\gamma}(1-q) +pq^{\gamma+1} \ee
First Order Condition:
\be 
-(N_t \tilde{L_2})^{\alpha-\gamma} q^\alpha+(N_t \tilde{L_2})^{\alpha-\gamma} (1-q) q^{\alpha-1} \alpha +p q^\gamma (1+\gamma)=0
\ee
We will find q is uniquely depended by p with the following relationship.
\be  
p=\f{(N_t \tilde{L_2})^{\alpha-\gamma} (q-\alpha+q\alpha)}{(1+\gamma) q^{1+\gamma-\alpha}}
\ee
Since $1>>\gamma>>\alpha$  We can reduce it approximately into: 
\be p=(N_t \tilde{L_2})^{\alpha-\gamma}\f{1}{1+\gamma} (1+\alpha-\f{\alpha}{q}) \ee
which gives us the following expression:
\be 
q=\f{\alpha}{1+\alpha-(1+\gamma)p (N_t \tilde{L_2})^{\gamma-\alpha}} \label{*}
\ee
Clearly we have $\f{\p q}{\p p}>0$ \qed\\


\textbf{Proof of Proposition 3} Recall equation (\ref{*}), what we have is $\f{\p q}{\p N_t} > 0 $ and  $\f{\p q}{\p \tilde{L_2}}>0 $. Combining to $N_t=N_{t-1} E[n_{t-1}]$ and $E(\tilde{L_2})=L_2-m E[n_t]$ We could have $\f{\p q}{\p E[n_{t-1}]}>0 $ and  $\f{\p q}{\p E[n_{t-1}]}< 0 $,where $E[.]$ denotes expectation signals.  \qed\\



\textbf{Proof of Proposition 4} We evaluate $\theta_t$, $x_t$, $n_t$ near the steady state. We will have
\be 
\begin{split}
U= & \max_n \f{1}{1-\sigma}[(\theta y_t)^{1-\sigma}-1]
\\& +\f{1}{1-\sigma}\beta \pi_1 \f{1}{1-\sigma} [((1-\f{1}{2}n\theta-\pi_2 x) y_t)^{1-\sigma}-1]
\\&+\f{1}{1-\sigma} \beta^2 \pi_1 \pi_2 [(\f{1}{2}x \pi_1 y_t)^{1-\sigma}-1]
\end{split}
\ee
and
\be \f{\p U}{\p n}= \beta \pi_1 [(1-\f{1}{2}n\theta)y_t]^{-\sigma}(-\f{1}{2}\theta y_t) +\beta^2 ]\pi_1 \pi_2 [\f{1}{2}x\pi_1 n y_t]^{-\sigma}(\f{1}{2}x \pi_1 y_t) \label{**} \ee
if 
\be  \beta>\f{(1-\f{1}{2}n\theta -\pi_2 x)^{-\sigma} \theta}{ \pi_2 (\f{1}{2} x \pi_1 n)^{-\sigma} x \pi_1} \ee
We will have $\f{\p U}{\p n}>0$.\\
Together with the constraint $n_t m \leq L_1$, we have 
\be n^*=\f{L_1}{m} \ee \qed\\

\textbf{Proof of Proposition 7} Under formula (28), if 
\be \beta_1 \pi_1^{1-\sigma}>\f{(1-\f{1}{2} n \theta -\pi_2 x)^{-\sigma}\theta}{\pi_2 (\f{1}{2}x n)^{-\sigma} x} \ee
the \be \f{\p U}{\p n}<0 \ee
which means the fertility rate will drop from $\f{L_1}{m}$. Also in this case the population growth rate will drop from $g^{max}$ \qed\\

\textbf{Proof of Proposition 8} Since $\f{\p {q_t}}{\p p_t}>0$. 
\be I_{q_{t+1}>q_t}= I_{p_{t+1}>p_{t}} \ee
Define $1+g_t=G_t>1$ is the population growth rate for period t. From the definition of $p_t$ we have:
\be 
\f{p_{t+1}}{p_t}=\f{p(Y_{t+1})}{p(Y_t)}*\f{\f{G_{t-1}G_t}{G_{t-1}G_t+G_{t-1}}}{\f{G_{t-1}}{G_t+1}}=\f{p(Y_{t+1})}{p(Y_t)}*\f{G_t}{G_{t-1}} \approx (1+p'())*\f{G_t}{G_{t-1}} =(1+\epsilon)*\f{G_t}{G_{t-1}}
\ee
 when 
\be \f{G_t}{G_{t-1}}<\f{1}{1+\epsilon} \ee 
the $p_{t+1}$ would decreases. 
And according \textbf{Proposition 1.} $q_{t+1}$ will also decrease. \qed\\

\textbf{Proof of Proposition 9} Let the relationship between $q_{t+1}$ and $q_t$ as a function T: $q_{t+1}=T(q_t)$. T is decided by setting all first order condition of equation (1) to 0. 
Since all the first order condition are continuous and differentiable, it could be seen that T constructs a Banach Space. $T: [0,1] \to [0,1]$. According to  
\textbf{Proposition 8.} it is convex, compact and has a sup norm. Therefore the fixed point exists according to  Schauder Fixed Point Theorem. The unique fixed point is the dynamic equilibrium. \qed

\begin{section} {Chapter 2: Working Overtime, Efficiency and Unemployment}
\begin{subsection} {Introduction}

The allocation of time remains in the central topic of labor economics.  Becker (1965) pioneers the work of interpreting the time allocation decision between working and other activities such as home production. It sheds the light for economists to study  how individuals behave in the labor market. Gronau (1976) revisits Becker's famous result and finds out that home production is affected differently by changes in socioeconomic variables comparing to leisure decision. Men and women tend to obtain different specific human capital training. For instance, married women tend to spend less effort in the labor market competition since child care and housework carry an intensive effort (Becker 1985). With technology progress and emancipation for the female
 from the family sector, women is more willing to participate in the labor market. Consequently, the participation rate for women increases from 21\% in 1900 to 59\% in 2009 (Bowen, William G., and T. Aldrich Finegan 2015). 

At the same time, we can never fail to notice that labor market behaviors vary with ages. Young women, for instance, have the tendency to work part-time or reduce the workload(Kunze, Astrid, and Kenneth R. Troske 2015) when entering the job market since the duties of raising kids reduce their interests for working during the child-bearing and child-raising age. Some young mummies even quit the labor market, which might be temporary. However, most of them would like to return to the job market when children grow up. This phenomenon could be explained as the domination of substitution effect  at the early stage of job market for young women. Traditionally it is believed that homogeneous agent model ignores the heterogeneity (culture-based heterogeneity in this paper), which could result in unreliable research conclusions. For some East Asian countries, for example, young women enter the labor market more intensively, where the culture could be distinct from the West (Yoon, Jayoung 2015). Particularly, the childbearing age-cohort female labor participation rate remains at high level, displaying a stronger income effect in Asian countries.  It could be the direct result of observed low fertility rate in the East Asian region, which could also be explained by the inverse causal effect. In fact, the domination of income effect could be explained by low subsidy to the childcare system or birth controlling policies (James Liang 2015, Fuxian Yi 2010). Added worker effect is a plausible explanation in this situation. Female workers are encouraged heavily by their husbands or families to join the labor market to support the family income.

Culture and cross-industry difference is another crucial factor to explain the heterogeneity. Investment banks, for example, may push the employers to work 80 or 100 hours per week to satisfy the job requirement, especially for the entry-level analysts or associates. These facts can be observed whenever you come across the Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley's offices in Manhattan. Also, most Chinese information technology companies strongly encourage workers to follow a so-called "996" working pattern, which means each employers should work from 9 am to 9 pm each working day and 6 days a week. Any worker who fail to obtain such workload criteria might be considered as "low ability" or "unsatisfied performance" so that she/he could be fired or lose the promotion possibilities. It is summarized by JH Kang, JG Matusik, LA Barclay (2015) and explained by culture difference that Asian  culture requires more working effort.

HUAWEI\footnote{you can raise a couple of other similar examples in the East Asian countries}, the CISCO major competitor  all over the world but USA, strongly encourages every junior engineers to work and sleep in the office and never go home but only pays them based on the 40 or 50 hours scheduled weekly working hours. In this case, many engineers could work more than 100 hours a week but only report 40 or 50 working hours to the Taxation and Labor Department so as not to break the worker-protection law.  The co-called  "wolf-culture", aka. working unreported overtime with little compensation, is the key for HUAWEI to compete with CISCO. You might wonder why the junior workers are willing to wait for 24/7 project assignments without reasonable compensations. If a junior worker displays sufficient hard working and loyalty by following such torturing job requirements, he/she would have a large chance to be promoted and get an outstanding payment throughout the industry. Other under-reported working overtime is the case in Japan. Junior workers are seldom allowed to leave the office before their bosses, which displays disrespect in Japanese culture. Even a low-rank employee finishes her/his job duties, she/he should wait until the direct boss leaves (WB Schaufeli, A Shimazu, TW Taris 2009), which leads to, in a certain extent, an excessive and compulsive working overtime. Also, coming home too early, say 7:30 pm, could be treated as a dangerous signal of potential unemployment, which is particularly true for young men workers. Hence, each worker in such situation works or pretends to work hard and leaves office later and later. (Samuel, Sidney W 2015)

This phenomenon enlightens the research that I propose in this paper. We are going to answer the following three questions. (1) Since leisure is generally considered as normal good, why do those workers wish to give up their precious leisure time to work for the reported or unreported excess workload? Do they work overtime in order to increase their promotion chances by sending signal of diligence or high ability? (2) Does the culture affect the work-leisure choices in those East Asian countries? Does such "leaving after the boss" belief reduce the utility and market efficiency level? If so, how does the culture bias influence the equilibrium? (3) If most people are willing to work overtime,  will the employer decrease the labor demand by recruiting less people to fulfill the job tasks? Will the overtime-working lead to an increasing unemployment rate?

We are going to build a heterogeneous agent model to answer the aforementioned questions.  After calibrating various social norm or regional culture with different utility function, we would like to discuss how equilibrium shifts under various social norm. Finally, we would like to use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data to examine our theoretical findings. 

The remaining parts of this article are organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on similar topics. Section 3 builds the standard model and discusses the equilibrium under various social normal assumptions. Section 4 describes the data we use and provides estimate for the theoretical results. Concluding remarks are made in Section 5.

\end{subsection}


\begin{subsection} {Literature Review}
There are extensive literature discussing the working hour difference between various regions. Even among OECD countries, the annual average working hour for a full-time worker varies. (Mexico 2,228, South Korea 2,124, USA 1,436, Japan 1,729, Denmark 1,436, Germany 1,371) (2014 OECD report).  In non-OECD regions, the annual working hours also distinct a lot. Hong Kongers and Singaporeans, for example,
have to work approximately 2400 hours per year while less than 1500 in some less developed regions. We can notice that the employers in some northwest European countries only work two-thirds of Mexicans and Koreans. It is explained by different ethic standards like Confucian ethics, where too much leisure is considered as laziness and immorality (JH Kang, JG Matusik, LA Barclay 2015).  

Akerlof (1976) pioneers the work that labor market equilibrium could result in inefficient long hours. It is also noticed by the academia community (Blair-Loy 2004) that firms might reserve the best jobs and opportunities for workers who can give long hours to their employers with very limited family responsibilities.  Gicheva (2013) documents that 5 extra hours are associated with a 1\% increase in annual wage growth but the relationship is not presents when weekly working hour is below 47, which displays the non-linear hour-wage relationship.

Mauss, Marcel (1923) describe the labor-wage contract as a kind of gift exchange process, where wage-payers exchange a gift of a wage premium for the expected high effort performance. By following this framework, if workers are willing to provide excess work, they should expect to receive high payoff currently or in the future, which is the increasing promotion chances \footnote{Treating the chances of promotion as options, the employees write the option at the early stage. If the employers could survive the challenging duties in the first period, the expected return of the option would be high. Otherwise, the option would expire in the second period and the option value is 0.} .  Akerlof, George A.(1982) uses a specific utility function to mimic the workers' effort. Each individual preference depends on her/his attitude towards fairness . If the employee cares nothing about fairness, the market equilibrium in this case will be the competitive equilibrium. If the fairness (altruism) level is positive there will be positive improvement on the wage and employment. And vice versa, which could also be a possible reason explaining the ubiquitously observed cross-industry wage differences(Akerlof, George A., and Janet L. Yellen 1988). Involuntary unemployment could be a direct result of negative fairness preference. Workers are discouraged to provide sufficient labor supply comparing to the competitive equilibrium with negative fairness preference. There would exist no involuntary unemployment when all employers are neutral (Akerlof, George A., and Janet L. Yellen 1990, Fehr, Ernst, and Klaus M. Schmidt 1999). The existence of non-monetary motivation in the preference function is tested by Gneezy and Rustichini (2000a \& 2000b) by examining the performance of the parents in the daycare centers in Israel. They conclude there indeed exists such selfish or altruism component in the utility function.

Also, there is alternative literature concluding that work-leisure choices are affected by policies. Osuna, Victoria (2003) finds out the taxing overtime wage could greatly reduce the observed excess overtime workings. They calibrate the model and conclude a marginal 12\% tax rate could reduce 8 hours a day (which is one hour excess work each working day) to 7 hours \footnote{7-hour a day is the regular working schedule for some European countries but not for USA, China and Japan}.
Nickell, Stephen, and Richard Layard (1999) discover that union strength and social welfare system play pivotal roles in explaining the unwillingness of working overtime for European societies. The stronger union protection for workers and the better social welfare benefits, the less effort people would like to supply in the labor market. They argue that increasing product market competition could be a remedy to solve the negative influence of unions and social security, which provides more incentive for employers to work hard.

There is an ongoing heated debate between pros and cons of working overtime. Some scholars argue the workers who work overtime display an extraordinary effort and efficiency level comparing to those employees who do not (Machlowitz, 1980; Peiperl, Jones, 2001). However, an opposite view is that workaholics increase the difficulties level by themselves, adding unnecessary complexities for their colleagues (Oates, 1971, Machlowitz, 1980, Porter, 2001), and therefore it could be problematic for the companies. Especially when the accomplishment of projects relies heavily on cooperation, such low-efficient performance could lead to excess workload to the co-workers and result a trouble-making working overtime culture. There is also some literature (Burke 2001, etc.) pointing out there is no relationship between the working overtime and the efficiency level, contradicting the positive or negative ability signal hypothesis. The positive outcomes could be an excess wage ratio for overtime workload while the negative could never be neglected at the same time. Researchers demonstrate there is a negative association between working overtime and weak health level such as high levels of stress, ill-health situation and strain (Sparks, Kate, et. al. 1997).

It could hardly be ignored that tenure structure influences the workers' selection on work-life balance. Robert A. Hart, Yue Ma (2013) test British plant and machine operatives and discover workers with longer tenure are more fond of supplying excess work. However, the marginal product during the over time is less than the wage premium, indicating potential low efficiency level when workers are fatigue. By noticing such phenomenon, the employees could lower the base wage rate in order to set the aggregate salary for the overtime-working staff the same level comparing to never overworking peers. There is little evidence that demand side serves as the main driven force for overtime working (Bell, David NF, and Robert A. Hart 2003). Usually speaking, extensive-margin elasticities are supposed to be higher than intensive-margin predicted by various macroeconomic models (Richard Rogerson
1988, Gary D. Hansen 1985, Lars Ljungqvist and Thomas J. Sargent 2006). In a sense, it is the case that working overtime should not be widely observed since the intensive adjustment to a higher compensation should be relatively small. However, recent literature(Chetty, Raj, et al 2011) argues the intensive-margin elasticity are significantly underestimated by the previous literature, which could possibly offer vigorous explanation for widely-existing overtime working. 

Overall speaking, there are various interpretations on the reason and influence of overtime working and economists have not yet reached out a convincing conclusion.
\end{subsection}

\begin{subsection} {Model Setup and General Equilibrium}
\begin{subsubsection} {Workers}
We build a competitive equilibrium model in the section. Following Bakshi, Gurdip S., and Zhiwu Chen(1996)'s approach, we may assume a worker lives forever and maximizes his/her lifetime utility.
\be
\max_{\{C_t\}_{t=0}^\infty, \{L_t\}_{t=0}^\infty} \beta^t E_0[U(C_t,L_t,S_t)]
\ee
where $\beta$ is the time preference parameter; $U(C_t, L_t, S_t)$ denotes the utility function of consumption level $C_t$, leisure $L_t$ and social status level $S_t$. Assume $U(.,.,.)$ are twice differentiable with each variable and $U_C$,$U_L>0$ , indicating that additional consumption or leisure creates positive marginal utility. We cannot assume $S_t$ have the similar characteristics at this moment. If the agent has no preference on the social status, i.e. $U_S =0$, then $U(.,.,,)$ has no relationship with $S$.\\
We maximize the target function subjected to the budget constraint \footnote{we first assume there is no stochastic term in the budget constraint},


\be
a_{t+1}-a_t=\mu_t a_t -C_t +w_t(S_t)
\ee

where $\mu_t$ represents the return on capital in period $t$ and $w_t(S_t)$ is the wage in period $t$ corresponding to the social status level $S_t$. $a_t$ is the asset level.

In this model, the social status variables $S_t$ are not direct choices variables for workers. The status will be determined by the employees after observing workers' labor effort and potential influential factors (for example luck). When $t$ increases from $0$ to infinity, we assume that the social status or the rank strictly increases. In other word, $ \{S=1\} \prec \{S=2\} \prec\{ S=3\} \prec ...\prec\{ S=t\} \prec \{S=t+1\} \prec ...$ and at the initial period $S_0=1$. It is assumed $S \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ is discrete without loss of generality.

We attempt to use four different models with various representative's preferences to explain our findings.

\textbf{Model 1}. (No preference on social status). \\
The worker has no preference on social status. In other word, there is no discrimination against various rank or social status.  In this case, $U_S=0$ and we have $U(C_t, L_t,S_t)=U(C_t, L_t)$. A Cobb-Douglas utility function is given by 
\be
U(C_t, L_t,S_t)= \f{(C_t^\rho L_t^{1-\rho} )^{1-\gamma} } {1-\gamma}
\ee

This assumption is consistent with M Lettau, H Uhlig (2000), as well as Rupert, Peter, Richard Rogerson, and Randall Wright (2000). We use this utility function since the marginal rate of substitution is a function of consumption and leisure. 
\be 
MRS_{t+1}= \beta (\f{C_{t+1}}{C_t} )^{\rho (1-\gamma)-1} (\f{L_{t+1}}{L_t})^{(1-\gamma)(1-\rho)}
\ee

Typically it is more likely to observe the utility function with $U_S=0$ in the most developed economies such as United States. People have no discrimination taste.

\textbf{Model 2}. (Utility level depends on the social status)\\

The representative agent's utility  depends not only on consumption and leisure but the social status as well in \textbf{Model 2} . 
\be
U(C_t, L_t, S_t)= \f{(C_t^\rho L_t^{1-\rho} )^{1-\gamma} } {1-\gamma} S_t^\eta
\ee

where $\eta$ depicts the preference level on the social status. If $\eta=0$, \textbf{Model 2} shrinks to $\textbf{Model 1}$ automatically. $\eta>0$ indicates a positive preference on social status. A higher social status may provide you more power and welfare such as travel benefits and respects. It is widely observed in most Confucian-dominated countries such as East Asia and Singapore that people have positive preference on social status. On the contrary, $\eta<0$ shows a negative preference, which might result from increasing peer pressure and responsibility. $\eta < 0$ could be observed in some European countries thanks to the well-developed social welfare system and religious influence.

\textbf{Model 3.} (Utility level depends on the ratio between individual social status and its social average)\\
In this case, the utility function turns into the following format.
\be
U(C_t, L_t, S_t)= \f{(C_t^\rho L_t^{1-\rho} )^{1-\gamma} } {1-\gamma} (\f{S_t}{\bar{S}})^\eta
\ee
where $\bar{S}$ represents the average social status. If $S_t <\bar{S}$, the agent is in the bottom half while $S_t>\bar{S}$ indicates an above average rank. If $S_t=\bar{S}$, then the agent is exactly in the median class. You could notice if we preset $\bar{S}$ as constant, then \textbf{Model 3} is exactly \textbf{Model 2}.

\textbf{Model 4.} (Utility depends on the self-identified social status level)\\
\be
U(C_t, L_t, S_t)= \f{(C_t^\rho L_t^{1-\rho} )^{1-\gamma} } {1-\gamma} (S_t-\kappa \bar{S})^\eta
\ee

where $\kappa >0$ is the worker's self-identified anti-poverty ``reservation'' coefficient. Notice when $S_t-\kappa \bar{S}<0$, the utility function will collapse to a negative value. As a result, a rational employer will never attempt choose a $S_t$ level below $\kappa \bar{S}$ by supplying sufficient labor market efforts to win higher chances of reaching positive utility(although sometimes could potentially result in a failure) . For instance, if we set $\kappa=\f{1}{2}$, a rational agent will find the bottom 50\% social status intolerable. Definitely, $\kappa$ relies heavily on the parents' social status and educational attainment. For instance, workers from prestigious ivy league universities are supposed to self-identify a higher level of $\kappa$ comparing to high school dropouts. Because of  the national constraint of $\kappa$, $\kappa$ could never exceed the ratio of self-selected social status and the community average, and consequently it is somehow difficult for a lower-class worker to self-identify a high $\kappa$. During the early age of the career, given the relative low opportunities being promoted to higher ranks, self-identified $\kappa$ should be no more than during the later stage of the career. Therefore, $\kappa$ might be time-variant. \textbf{Model 2.} is the particular case of \textbf{Model 4} when $\kappa=0$.

\textbf{Model 1} to \textbf{Model 4} are inspired by the spirit of Bakshi, Gurdip S., and Zhiwu Chen (1996) and Campbell, John Y., and John H. Cochrane (1995).
\end{subsubsection}
\begin{subsubsection}{Firms}
We assume the only input is labor.  The firm uses heterogeneous labor inputs with different level to maximize its profit level. The only cost is wage expenditure.
\be
\pi=\max \prod_{\sum_{S_j=i} S_j>0} (\sum_{S_j=i} S_j)^{\lambda_i }- \sum_{\sum_{S_j=i}S_j>0} \sum_{S_j=i}w(S_j)
\ee

In other word,

\bes
\ba
\pi =  \max \{ &\prod_{i} (\text{number of employers with rank i})^{\lambda_i }\\ & - \sum_{i} \text{number of employers with rank i} * w(S=i)\}
\ea
\ees

where $\pi$ is the profit level and  $\lambda_i$ denotes the corresponding exponent for social status $S=i$. If we requires constant returns to scale technology, $\sum \lambda_i=1$ should hold. However, at this moment constant returns to scale is not assumed. $w(S_j)$ is the wage function for workers in rank $S_j$, which is constant within each rank.

It is assumed that the wage for each worker only depends on their rank but not working hours and experience. This compensation structure is typically observed in most high-tech companies. Google, for instance, provides a fresh master junior employer with Level 2 class with a package of approximately \$ 150,000 per year (base salary+bonus+restricted stock units) while a fresh PhD junior employer with Level 3 class a with a package of approximately \$200,000 per year.

In this model, however, high class workers could be treated as durable goods that could hardly be replaced in the short run. Low class workers are considered to be non-durable goods which could be substituted with other competitors on the job market without difficulties. For instance, if there are only two classes (leader with rank 2 and worker with rank 1) in the model, we can treat leader as capital good and worker as labor input in the Cobb-Douglas form production function.  

We also assume the relative output elasticities for class $i$ and class $j$ should only relate to the distance between $i$ and $j$ (ie. $|i-j|$). In particular we have
\be
\f{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}=\f{\lambda_2}{\lambda_3}=...= \lambda >1 \ (say)
\ee
As a result we can assume $\lambda_i=\lambda^{-i}, \forall i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. If the number of classes goes to infinity and constant returns to scale is assumed, we have $\lambda_i=\f{1}{2^i}, \forall i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

Assume there are $n_i$ workers in class $i$. Under the First Order Conditions with respect to rank $i$ and rank $i+1$ in the profit function and assuming the aggregate wage packages for each class being the same, we should have 
\be \label{A}
\f{i n_i}{(i+1) n_{i+1}}=\f{\lambda_i}{\lambda_{i+1}}=\f{1}{\lambda}, \ \  \forall i \in \mathbb{Z}^+

Assuming equal aggregate wage packages is consistent with widely observed wage structure in high-tech companies. Microsoft, for instance, CEO Nadella earns approximately 100 million annually while Microsoft has approximately 2,000-4,000 lowest level employers with less than \$ 50,000 compensation.

The following relationship between the number of workers in each classes is obtained by solving  (\ref{A}).
\be
n_i=(\f{1}{\lambda})^{i-1} \f{1}{i} n_1\ \  \forall i \in \mathbb{Z}^+
\ee
We can easily identify that $n_1 \geq n_2 \geq n_3 \geq ... \geq n_t \geq...\geq 0$. Assume the total number of workers is fixed number $N$, there must exist a unique  $k\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $n_k>0$ and $n_t=0 , \ \forall t>k$.

\textbf{Proposition 1}. The overall number of classes $k$ with the firm is decided by the total worker number $N$ and the relative output elasticities $\lambda$ between adjacent classes. It can be uniquely determined by solving the following simultaneous inequalities.
\be \label{B}
\begin{cases}
\sum_{i=1}^k (\f{1}{\lambda})^{i-1}  \f{1}{i} n_1=N \\ (\f{1}{\lambda})^{k-1} \f{1}{k} n_1 \geq1 \\ (\f{1}{\lambda})^k \f{1}{k+1} n_1 <1 
\end{cases}
\ee

The economic meaning of inequalities (\ref{B}) is quite straightforward. The firm no longer needs to set class $k+1$ to maximize the profit level. For instance, the prestigious hedge fund Two Sigma has altogether 800 employees and  7 class level (T1 the lowest class to T7 CEO). The following \textbf{Proposition 2} is obtained the the proof is provided in the appendix.

\textbf{Proposition 2.}  The total number of  class level $k$ is a non-decreasing function with respect to the total number of workers $N$ and non-increasing function with respect to the relative output elasticities $\lambda$ between adjacent classes.

\textbf{Proposition 2} is quite intuitive. The total class number should increase with the number of employees. For instance, Baidu, the famous search engine company with more than 20,000 staff in China, has a total 11 classes  while Two sigma has 7 classes with an approximate 800 staff. Also, it should decrease with respect to the  promoting difficulty level. Apple, with more challenging promotion criteria, has less ranking classes comparing to Google with similar size but larger promotion chances and more classes.

We assume all workers enter the firm with $S_0=1$. Outputs are hard to measure\footnote{In Yang(2001), if the output are hard to measure for the firm, it is better to use the fixed wage rate for each class. For instance, research outcome is hard to measure in research universities in the short run, so the wage rate is relatively fixed for tenure-track assistant professors, tenured associate professors and full professors. Research institutes will measure the publication quality to make the tenure decision within the tenure clock. However, if the outcomes are easy to measure, then piece rate wage is better than fixed wage. It is rational to make the assumption that wage rate only depends on the class in this model.}. Only working time could be observed by the firm to make the final promotion decision. Also, it is rational to assume in each period a worker can be promoted up to one class at most and no one could be downgraded(In other word, $0\leq S_{t+1} -S_t \leq 1, \ \ \forall t \in \mathbb{Z}^+$). According to Central Limit Theorem, all workers' working hours follow normal distribution if they are independent. The firm uses Maximum Likelihood Estimate to finish the promotion decision.
\be
S_{t+1}(\omega)=\begin{cases} S_t(\omega)+1,  \ \ with\ \  prob. \ \ \int_{-\infty}^{l_t(\omega)}  \f{p_c}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp(-\f{(\xi-\bar{l_c})^2}{2\sigma^2}) d \xi  \\ S_t(\omega), \ \ \ \ \ \ \ otherwise   \end{cases}
\ee
where $\bar{l_c}$ is the average working hour for all the staff in the class of $S_t=c$ and $l_t(\omega)$ is the working hour choice of person $\omega$, where $l_t(\omega)=1-L_t(\omega)$.   By revisiting (\ref{A}) we obtain
\be
0 \leq p_c=\f{c}{c+1}\f{1}{\lambda} <1
\ee
And by setting the base wage for level 1 at $w_1 (w(S_j=1)=w_1$) we conclude the following wage equation.
\be
w_i=w(S_j=i)=i \lambda^{i-1} w_1, \forall i \geq 1
\ee
\end{subsubsection}

\begin{subsubsection} {Equilibrium}
The Bellman Equation for the employees is as follows.
\be
V(a_t,S_t)=\max_{C_t, L_t} \{ U(C_t,L_t,S_t)+\beta E_o V(a_{t+1}, S_{t+1})    \}
\ee
subject to
\be
C_{t}=(1+\mu_t)a_t+w_t(S_t)-a_{t+1}
\ee
We eliminate the choice variable $C_t$ by rewriting the budget constraint and get the following Bellman Equation with choice variables $a_{t+1}$, $L_t$, and state variables $a_t$, $S_t$.
\be
V(a_t,S_t)=\max_{a_{t+1},L_t} \{ U((1+\mu_t)a_t+w_t(S_t)-a_{t+1}, L_t, S_t)+\beta E_0 V(a_{t+1}, S_{t+1})     \}
\ee
We have the following two First Order Conditions.\\
With respect to $a_{t+1}$:
\be
-U_c^t+\beta V_1 (a_{t+1},S_{t+1})=0
\ee
With respect to $L_t$:
\be
U_L^t-\beta V_1(a_{t+1},S_{t+1}) \f{\p a_{t+1}}{\p l_t}   -\beta V_2 (a_{t+1}, S_{t+1}) \f{\p S_{t+1}}{\p l_t} =0
\ee
Also we generate two Envelope Conditions.\\
With respect to $a_t$:
\be
V_1(a_t,S_t)=U_c^t(1+\mu_t)
\ee
With respect to $S_t$:
\be
V_2(a_t, S_t)=U_c^t \f{\p w_t(S_t)}{\p S_t} +U_s^t
\ee
where 
\be
 \f{\p w_t(S_t)}{\p S_t}=\lambda^{S_t-1}w_1(1+S_t \ln \lambda)
\ee
We could reach the following Euler Equations.
\be \label{EE1}
\underbrace{U_c^t}_{Marginal\ utility\ of\ consumption\ in\ period\ t}=\beta (1+\mu_t) \underbrace{U_c^{t+1}}_{Marginal\ utility\ of\ consumption\ in\ period\ t+1}
\ee
Notice $\f{\p a_{t+1}}{\p l_t}=0$ (next period's initial wealth level is not affected by current labor input level). We should have
\be \label{EE}
\begin{split}
& U_L^t\\
&=(1-p^*)\beta\underbrace{ [\overbrace{U_c^{t+1}\lambda^{S_t-1} (1+S_t \ln \lambda)w_1  }^{MU\ of\ consumption\ with\ labor}+\overbrace{U_S^{t+1}}^{MU\ of\ status\ with\ labor}] \f{S_t}{S_t+1} \f{1}{\lambda} \f{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp (-\f{(l_t-\bar{l_{S_t}})^2}{2\sigma^2}) }_{marginal\ utility\ of\ labor\ if\ not\ promoted} \\ & + p^*\beta\underbrace{ [U_c^{t+1}\lambda^{S_t} (1+(S_t+1) \ln \lambda)w_1  +U_S^{t+1}] \f{S_t}{S_t+1} \f{1}{\lambda} \f{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp (-\f{(l_t-\bar{l_{S_t}})^2}{2\sigma^2}) }_{marginal\ utility\ of\ labor\ if\ promoted}
\end{split}
\ee
where the promotion probability $p^*$ is
\be
p^*=\int_{-\infty}^{l_t} \f{\f{S_t}{S_t+1} \f{1}{\lambda}}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp(-\f{(\xi-\bar{l_{S_t}})^2}{2\sigma^2})d\xi
\ee
Briefly speaking, Euler Equation (\ref{EE}) shows the representative worker will increase the labor effort until the marginal utility from the increasing chances of promotion being equal to the marginal utility loss with respect to leisure when providing additional unit of labor.  We will discuss the different consumption and labor choices under \textbf{Model 1} to \textbf{Model 4} assumptions. 

For \textbf{Model 1.}, we evaluate $C_t$ and $L_t$ at their steady state and the following relationship between $\beta$ and $\mu_t$ is summarized.
\be
\beta (1+\mu_t) \equiv 1, \forall t\geq 1
\ee
However, it is the usual case that the return on $\{ \mu_t  \}_{t=1}^\infty $ fluctuates around the steady state. Generally, during the Great Moderation economists tend to believe that the long term rate will approach to a constant since the volatility keeps decreasing. However, the recent Great Recession breaks the illusion of economists and consequently, the fluctuation of $C_t$ and $L_t$ could be the direct result from the variation of $\mu_t$.

Also, from (\ref{EE}), we should have
\be
L^e=\{ \f{p^e \beta \rho C^{e\ \rho-1}\lambda^{S^e-1}w_1 [(1-p^e)(1+S^e \ln \lambda)+ p^e \lambda (1+(S^e+1)\ln \lambda)]  }  {1-\rho}   \}^{-\f{1}{\rho}}
\ee
where $C^e$, $S^e$, $L^e$ are the steady state of $C_t$, $S_t$ and $L_t$, where
\be
p^e=\f{S^e}{2(S^e+1)\lambda}
\ee

The properties of the steady state could be derived without difficulties.

\textbf{Proposition 3.} $\f{\p L^e}{\p \beta}<0$. It indicates the steady state working level will be higher if the worker have an increasing preference level on the future period, which could be expected in the infinity period problems due to income effect.

\textbf{Proposition 4.} $\f{\p L^e}{\p \rho}<0$. If the preference for consumption over leisure is higher, then the equilibrium working level should increase, which is also quite intuitive due to substitution effect between consumption and leisure.

\textbf{Proposition 5.} $ \f{\p L^e}{\p S^e}<0$. That is to say, if the equilibrium social status increases, the leisure level at the steady state will be lower. Obviously, it is due to substitution effect such that with higher class/social status the income will be higher, which generates a higher utility level.

\textbf{Proposition 6.} $\f{\p L^e}{\p C^e} <0$. With higher equilibrium leisure, the consumption level will be lower, which seems to be intuitive at first glance. 
Notice that the representative agent will never choose any unnecessary additional working hour since the marginal utility loss would be higher than the marginal utility gain from the potential promotion, given the additional working hour could not significantly enhance the belief for  the firm that this worker is indeed working hard to be promoted. In short, "lazy" people have with less consumption.

\textbf{Proposition 7.} $\f{\p L^e}{\p \lambda}< 0$.The working hour will increase with respect to the relative output elasticities between adjacent classes $\lambda$. We should also notice that $\lambda$ is positively correlative to the difficulty of promotion and negatively correlative to the number of classes. It could also be obtained that the more difficult for each promotion and the less classes in the hierarchy systems, the equilibrium working level should be higher as well as the consumption level.  For instance, when we revisit the stories of Two Sigma and Apple, it is widely-known that Apple has a relatively stricter promotion policy than Two Sigma for coding and machine learning group. With \textbf{Proposition 7} we shall reach the conclusion that Apple is the priority choice for hard-workers comparing to Two Sigma, which is exactly what we observed in reality when you come across the parking lots for both companies during weekends.

For \textbf{Model 2}, we evaluate the Euler Equation with respect to consumption and evaluate the consumption, class, leisure, interest rate at their corresponding steady state. ( ie $C_t=C^e$, $S_t=S^e$, $L_t=L^e$ $\mu_t=\mu$).
\be \label{M2A}
\begin{split}
S^{e \eta} & =   \beta(1+\mu) \f{S^e}{2(S^e+1)\lambda} (S^e+1)^\eta +\beta(1+\mu) (1-\f{S^e}{2(S^e+1)\lambda}) S^{e\eta}\\
& = \beta(1+\mu) S^{e\eta} +\beta(1+\mu) \f{S^e}{2(S^e+1)\lambda} \sum_{k=1}^\infty \binom{\eta}{k}  S^{e \  \eta-k }
\end{split}
\ee
From (\ref{M2A}) it can be found that $\beta (1+\mu) < 1$, which indicates the preference for current consumption is higher in \textbf{Model 2} comparing to \textbf{Model 1}.

\textbf{Proposition 8.} From the (\ref{M2A}) we should have $\f{\p S^e}{\p \beta}<0$ when $\eta<\f{5}{6} \beta(1+\mu)$.\\
Proof is provided in the appendix. We could conclude if the preference for current period utility is high, the employee will tend to chase for a higher level of social status. With very similar logic, the following proposition is obtained.

\textbf{Proposition 9.} $\f{\p S^e}{\p \mu}<0$ when $\eta<\f{5}{6} \beta(1+\mu)$.\\
It is straightforward if the return on asset is low, which is similar to the effect of a low $\beta$, the preference for current period is higher and the corresponding feedback is to hunt for  a higher social level.

Then we repeat the same procedure and gain the following expression for the steady state of leisure.
\be \label{M2B}
A L^{e\ -\rho} +B L^{e\ 1-\rho}=D
\ee
where
\be
A=1-\rho >0
\ee
\be
B=-p^e(1-p^e) \beta \f{C^{e \rho} \eta}{(1-\gamma)S^e}-p^{e\ 2} \beta \f{C^{e\ \rho}\eta}{(1-\gamma)S^e} <0  \ if \ \gamma <1
\ee
\be
D=p^e \beta \rho C^{e\ \rho-1} \lambda^{S_e-1} w_1 [(1-p^e)(1+S^e \ln \lambda)+p^e \lambda (1+(S^e+1)\ln \lambda)] >0
\ee
and 
\be
p^e=\f{S^e}{2(S^e+1)\lambda}
\ee
We have the following important result.\\
\textbf{Proposition 10.} $\f{\p L^e}{\p \eta}<0$ when $\gamma \leq 1$ and $ \f{\p L^e}{\p \eta}$ is ambiguous when $\gamma>1$ . In particular, when $\eta=0$ \textbf{Model 2} shrinks to \textbf{Model 1}. Consequently the steady state leisure level under positive preference on the social status should be higher than no preference case if the relative risk aversion level is small ($\gamma \leq 1$), which is still higher than the negative preference case.

The proof is not hard, which is included in the appendix.

%\includegraphics [width=17cm, height= 10 cm]{JMP2graph1.jpg}
With no preference on social status case $\eta=0$ when the relative risk aversion level is low, the worker simply chooses the optimal working level where marginal consumption benefit from working equals marginal loss from sacrificing leisure.  However, in positive preference on social status case($\eta>0$), the  working level is chosen at the point where marginal utility loss from decreasing leisure equals marginal consumption benefit from working plus marginal status gain from the increasing chances of promotion. Employee tends to work more than no preference case since working provides additional benefit \footnote{It could be treated as a sort of additional substitution effect because of higher "income" from social status gain.} in class enhancement besides consumption benefit.
On the contrary, when $\eta<0$  the preference for status is negative. The working level is selected at the point where marginal benefit from consumption less the utility loss from a higher status  equals marginal loss from a diminishing leisure level, which leads to a higher leisure level comparing to no preference case. But when the relative risk aversion ratio $\gamma$ is high enough, it might happen that the income effect dominates the substitution effect, which leads to an ambiguous change in the labor input level \footnote{See Chetty Raj 2005, if $\gamma >1.25$ in his approach, the income effect might dominate substitution effect, leading a potential downward sloping labor supply curve.}.

For \textbf{Model 3.} $\bar{S}$ is calculated as the following expression.
\be
\bar{S}=\int Sd F(S)
\ee
where $F(S)$ is the cumulative distribution function of $S$.

The general conclusion for \textbf{Model 3} would not be significantly different from \textbf{Model 2} where the workers care relative social status in \textbf{Model 3} while focus on absolute class in \textbf{Model 2}. If the skewness of $F(S)$ is zero (for example normal distribution), the optimum working-leisure choice decision function will be exactly the same as the previous case. However, it is generally believed that the class structure is right skewed (positive skewness with some extent of income inequality). In this case $\bar{S}$ will be greater than the equilibrium social status. Therefore, the marginal utility gain from a higher status with more labor input will be smaller in \textbf{Model 3}, which leads to a higher equilibrium leisure level in this case. In a unlikely-to-be-true negative skewness case, the equilibrium leisure will be less than \textbf{Model 2} case, encouraging each worker to work even harder and consumes less leisure. It is observed in some Korea-culture-dominate corporations such as Samsung.

For $\textbf{Model 4}$, let $\tilde{S}=S-\kappa \bar{S}$. When we replace $S$ with $\tilde{S}$ in the Euler Equation of \textbf{Model 2}, the Euler Equation for \textbf{Model 4} is therefore obtained. If $\kappa>0$ the equilibrium status level must be higher. 

The economic explanation for $\kappa$ is that it represents the self-identified ambition level. Clearly the well-educated worker tends to have a higher $\kappa$ value, chasing a higher position in the company. In this case, the equilibrium working hour will be longer and the corresponding consumption level is enhanced. For instance, if in a particular society a level 1 steady state class level in never tolerated, then $\kappa$ will be intentionally selected above $1/ \bar{S}$. Any rational worker will never stay at $S=1$ for very long time since the utility level is negative no matter how much consumption the employee could have.

 $\textbf{Model 4}$ also provides groundbreaking evidence to explaining the asset return difference among various countries. Suppose we have two economies (type H and type L with corresponding ambition level $\kappa_H$ and $\kappa_L$  where $\kappa_H > \kappa_L$) and the observed average social status are the same for those two economies. In other word, $S_H=S_L$. Since $\kappa_H > \kappa_L$, we get
\be
S_H-\kappa_H \bar{S} =\tilde{S_H} < \tilde {S_L} =S_L-\kappa_L \bar{L}
\ee
With \textbf{Proposition 9} we can conclude the $\mu_H >\mu_L$, which indicates type H economy would have a rate of return on asset (which is an exogenous variable in my model). With the same logic and \textbf{Proposition 8}, we could also conclude a higher $\beta$ should be accompanied with a higher realized rate of return on asset. However, when higher $\kappa$ leads to advanced level of economic growth, we can fail to conclude that the corresponding self-identified utility level is also high. Taking Japan as an example, Japanese care greatly on the relative social status and seldom tolerate staying on the low class within the company. Consequently the labor hour is very high and so is consumption level. The self-identified utility level, however, might be the lowest among OECD countries with the highest suicide rate. A high ambition level $\kappa$ greatly reduces the utility level, pushing everyone inside the economy chasing a higher rank with more labor input and less leisure with heavy exhaustion.

One more thing to mention is the influence of the working hour standard deviation $\sigma$\footnote{See Storesletten, Kjetil, Chris I. Telmer, and Amir Yaron (2001), the standard deviation of US working hour is quite stable comparing to non-financial income and consumption.}. If the worker are approximately homogeneous, then $\sigma$ would be relatively small. As a result, a few more hours can significantly increase the promotion probability, increasing the utility for the worker sharply without much leisure loss. On the contrary, if $\sigma$ is high, only the employee who sacrifices a considerable amount of leisure is more likely to be promoted. Therefore, unless the positive preference over social status is high enough (for instance, a high $\kappa$ or $\eta$), the employee will be reluctant to trade more leisure for consumption and social status.

\begin{subsubsection} {Stochastic Case and Risk Premium}

In this part we consider the general asset pricing problem. Assume there are one risk- free asset with return $\mu_0$ and M risky assets . The price of $i^{th}$ risky asset in period $t$ $P_{i,t}$ satisfies the following Geometric Brownian Motion. 

\be
\f{d P_{i,t}}{P_{it}} =\mu_{i,t} dt+\sigma_{i,t} d B^P_{i,t},  \forall 1 \leq i  \leq M, \forall t \in \mathbb{N}
\ee
where $\mu_{it}$ are the expected drifts and $\sigma_{i,t}$ are standard deviation. $B^P_{i,t}$ stands for standard Brownian Motion.  

We assume the employee invests $w_{0,t}$ percentage of total investable asset on the risk-free asset in period t while puts $w_{i,t}$ percentage on risky asset $i$. Definitely we should have
\be
\sum_{i=0}^M w_{i,t}=1,  \forall t \in \mathbb{N}
\ee
The new choice variables become $\{w_{i,t}\}_{t=0}^{M}$, $a_{t+1}$ and $L_t$ in the original discounted utility maximization function.

\be
\max_{ \{ \{w_{i,t} \}_{i=0}^M,  \{L_t\}, \{a_{t+1}\}  \}_{t=0}^\infty } \beta^t E_0 [U(C_t, L_t, S_t)]
\ee
subject to 
\be
a_{t+1}-a_t=w_{0,t} a_t + \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_{i,t} a_t -C_t +\sum_{i=1}^M w_{i,t} \sigma_{i,t} B^P_{i,t}
\ee
Following the procedure of Bakshi, Gurdip S., and Zhiwu Chen (1996) and Grossman, Sanford J., and Robert J. Shiller (1982), we obtain the following Euler Equation with respect to the price of risky asset.

\be \label{EE2}
P_{i,t}=\beta E_t \{ [ \f{U_c(C_{t+1}, L_{t+1}, S_{t+1})}{U_c(C_t, L_t, S_t)} +\f{U_s (C_{t+1}, L_{t+1}, S_{t+1})}{U_c(C_t, L_t, S_t)} ] P_{i, t+1}   \}
\ee
which are all evaluated on the optimal path $C_t=C_t^*$, $C_{t+1}=C_{t+1}^*$, $L_t=L_t^*$, $L_{t+1}=L_{t+1}^*$, $S_t=S_t^*$, $S_{t+1}=S_{t+1}^*$.

Notice when the worker has no preference on social status, the above Euler equation (\ref{EE2}) is exactly the same as Euler Equation (\ref{EE1})

We further assume $C_t$, $L_t$ and $S_t$ satisfy the following stochastic processes.
\be
\f{d C_t}{C_t}=\mu_{C,t} dt + \sigma_{C,t} d B^C_{i,t}
\ee
\be
\f{d L_t}{L_t}=\mu_{L,t} dt + \sigma_{L,t} d B^L_{i,t}
\ee
\be
\f{d S_t}{S_t}=\mu_{S,t} dt + \sigma_{S,t} d B^S_{i,t}
\ee
where $\mu_{C,t}$, $\mu_{L,t}$, $\mu_{S,t}$ are the expected drift and $ \sigma_{C,t}$, $ \sigma_{L,t}$, $ \sigma_{S,t}$ are the expected diffusion. $B^C_{i,t}$, $B^L_{i,t}$, $B^S_{i,t}$ are three different standard Brownian Motion.

By subtracting the risk-free component from the (\ref{EE2}), we have
\be
E_t \{ [\f{U_C(C^*_{t+1}, L^*_{t+1},S^*_{t+1})}{ U_C(C^*_t, L^*_t, S^*_t)}+ \f{U_S(C^*_{t+1}, L^*_{t+1},S^*_{t+1})}{ U_C(C^*_t, L^*_t, S^*_t)}] (\f{d P_{i,t}}{P_{i,t}} -r_0 dt)    \}=0
\ee
$U_S(C^*_{t+1}, L^*_{t+1},S^*_{t+1})$ could be omitted when we use Taylor Series Approximation around the point $(C^*_{t+1}, L^*_{t+1},S^*_{t+1})$.
\be
E_t[(\mu_{i,t}-r_0) dt+\f{d P_{i,t} }{P_{i,t}}] [1+ \f{U_{CC}C_t^*}{U_C} \f{d C_t^*}{C_t^*} +  \f{U_{CL}L_t^*}{U_C} \f{d L_t^*}{L_t^*} + \f{U_{CS}S_t^*}{U_C} \f{d S_t^*}{S_t^*}  ]=0
\ee
let 
\be
d B^P_{i,t} d B^C_{i,t}= V_{P,C} dt
\ee
\be
d B^P_{i,t} d B^L_{i,t}= V_{P,L} dt
\ee
\be
d B^P_{i,t} d B^S_{i,t}= V_{P,S} dt
\ee
With It$\hat{o}$'s Lemma,  we could calculate the following risk premium for $P_{i,t}$ .
\be
\mu_{i,t}-r_0=-\f{U_{CC} V_{P,C}}{U_C P_{i,t}}-\f{U_{CL} V_{P,L}}{U_C P_{i,t}}-\f{U_{CS} V_{P,S}}{U_C P_{i,t}}
\ee
Fama-French three factor model (Fama, Eugene F., and Kenneth R. French 1993) states that consumption risk should be compensated and included in the asset risk premium while Zhang Lu q-Factor Model (Hou, Kewei, Chen Xue, and Lu Zhang 2015) states investment risk should be the dominant component in the Capital Asset Pricing Model. While in our approach, not only the consumption risk but the leisure risk and social status risk should be compensated. For instance, if we assume $\rho=0$ and $\eta=0$ in \textbf{Model 2}, our model should be very similar to the original CAPM approach. While we only set $\eta=0$ in \textbf{Model 2}, it becomes a two-factor model considering both consumption and leisure risk. When you use the general assumption in \textbf{Model 2}, it turns out to become a consumption-leisure-class CAPM approach, which definitely, deserves future research.


\end{subsubsection}

\begin{subsubsection} {Option Explanation}
In this part, we attempt the explain the behavior of employee using an alternative approach. Instead of the traditional Euler Equation approach, we treat the promotion opportunity as a call option. For example, in the first period, all workers have the class level 1 and are issued a call option with strike price "S=2". It is a binary call option\footnote{The payoff of this binary call option is either 0 or being promoted to class 2.} with a positive probability of being promoted to the social status $S=2$ through current observed labor input $l$. We denote the price of such call option $call(L, S=1 \to 2)$. At the same time, being promoted class level 2 means the additional promotion probability of being promoted to level 3 in the next period, which could be treated as a call on call option. And so on. Consequently, the call option combination in period 1 not only contains a call option of being promoted to level 2 in the next period, but contains a call of a call option of being promoted to level 3 in the next two periods ,..., and so on. So the overall value of such option combinations is calculated as follows.
\be
P=\sum_{i=2}^\infty \f{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1+\mu_j)} call(L, S=1 \to i)
\ee
In \textbf{Model 1}, for example, the workers'  preference for the social status is 0. In this case, all the benefit of promotion is pecuniary effect. 
\be
call^{Model\ 1}(L, S=1 \to i)=((i+1)\lambda^i-i\lambda^{i-1})w_1 Pr(1 \to i)
\ee
where 
\be
\begin{split}
Pr(1 \to i) &= \prod_{j=1}^{i-1}[ \f{1}{\lambda} \f{j}{j+1}\int_{-\infty}^L \f{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp (-\f{(L-\bar{L})^2}{2\sigma^2})  ]\\ &= \f{1}{\lambda^{i-1} i } (\int_{-\infty}^L \f{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp (-\f{(L-\bar{L})^2}{2\sigma^2}))^{i-1}
\end{split}
\ee
Further if we assume $\mu_j \equiv \mu, \forall j \in \mathbb{N}$ , then the price of such option combination is 
\be
P=w_1\sum_{i=2}^\infty \f{1}{(1+\mu)^{i-1}}[ (\f{i+1}{i} \lambda -1) (\int_{-\infty}^L \f{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp (-\f{(L-\bar{L})^2}{2\sigma^2}))^{i-1} ]
\ee
A worker will choose the when the Delta of this call option ($\Delta_P=\f{\p P}{\p L}$) equals the marginal utility of leisure. 

Let us discuss the how parameters will influence the median worker's option combination value. Plug $L=\bar{L}$ into the expression of $P$ and we can figure out
\be
\begin{split}
P &=w_1 \sum_{i=2}^\infty \f{1}{(2(1+\mu))^{i-1}}((\f{i+1}{i})\lambda-1 )\\
&=w_1 [ \f{-(1+2\lambda \mu)+2\lambda (1+\mu)(1+2\mu) \ln (\f{2+2\mu}{1+2\mu})}{1+2\mu}  ]
\end{split}
\ee
Clearly we should have $\f{\p P}{\p \lambda}>0 $ and $\f{\p P}{\p \mu}<0$, which is consistent with the characteristics of a call option that the Rho should be negative.

When we reconsider \textbf{Model 2} to \textbf{Model 4}
\be
call^{Model\ 2 \sim 4}(L, S=1 \to i)=[((i+1)\lambda^i-i\lambda^{i-1})+MU_S ]w_1 Pr(1 \to i)
\ee
where $MU_S $ is the additional marginal utility gain from the increasing of social status, which is positive, negative or zero when the worker has positive, negative or no preference on the social status. In this case
\be
P^{Model\ 2\sim 4}\underset{<}{\overset{>}{=}}P^{Model\ 1}
\ee
and
\be
\Delta_P^{Model\ 2\sim 4}\underset{<}{\overset{>}{=}}\Delta_P^{Model\ 1}
\ee
Consequently we have
\be
L^{Model\ 2\sim 4} \underset{>}{\overset{<}{=}}L^{Model\ 1}
\ee
when $\eta \underset{<}{\overset{>}{=}} 0$

\begin{subsection}{Empirical Tests}
\begin{subsubsection}{Data Description}

Obviously, we should use panel data to study the dynamic work-leisure behavior. In this case, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data is selected to accomplish our empirical test. The data range are from 1975 to 1992, which the same cohort and their descendants are surveyed through phone call annually. The beginning year 1975 is selected in particular since it is the time points when reliable phone interviews were used and the ending year 1992 is chosen since  from 1993 computer techniques are introduced into the survey. During this period the measurement errors could be regarded as homogeneous. 

We have approximately 7,000 effective observations for each year, where the summary statistics of age, education, hours working per year and annual before-tax income for labor market participants  are provided in Table 29. In our approach, a worker is considered to be a labor market participant if his/her annual paid working hours are no less than 200 and the age is between 25 and 70.

From Table 30 to Table 33 we summarize the age, education level, hours working per year and nominal income for each year in 1975 to 1992. The educational level increases steadily in those 18 years while the variance decreases significantly during 1984-1988. A representative working employee increases the working hour during George H.W. Bush presidential term. The nominal income increases sharply during 1980s. We can notice the nominal average income for 1990 in PSID panel survey was almost 200\% of 1980, which could be majorly explained by the high inflation rate\footnote{The inflation rate during 1975-1992 is listed in Table 34} during that period. Notwithstanding, the real inflation-adjusted average income is still growing during Ronald Reagon's presidency but becoming much slower, which is listed in Table 35.

The next very important thing in our model is to calibrate $\lambda$ and the corresponding number of classes. Since we use Cobb-Douglas form technology,  we have better follow Cobb-Douglas's original approach (Charles Cobb, Paul Douglas \& NBER 1927,  Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow 1976,  Filipe, Jesus; Adams, F. Gerard 2005) to set $\lambda=3$. The effective response for each year is approximately 7,000, which leads to an estimated 7 classes altogether by following the decision rule in \textbf{Proposition 2} by noticing
\be
\sum_{i=1}^7 3^{i-1}i=7,108
\ee
We use the wage function to decide the class level approximately. By following (58), the higher wage, the higher social status. By setting the living wage as the separation line of class 1 and class 2 and following the spirit of equation (58) we use the following rule to decide the social class level.

\begin{itemize}
\item class 1: if the hourly wage in year t $\in$ (0, hourly wage$^t_{max}/64]$
\item class 2: if the hourly wage  working hour  in year t $\in$ (hourly wage$^t_{max}/64$, hourly wage$^t_{max}/32]$
\item class 3: if the hourly wage in year t $\in$ (hourly wage$^t_{max}/32$, hourly wage$^t_{max}/16]$
\item class 4: if the hourly wage  in year t $\in$ (hourly wage$^t_{max}/16$, hourly wage$^t_{max}/8]$
\item class 5: if the hourly wage  in year t $\in$ (hourly wage$^t_{max}/8$, hourly wage$^t_{max}/4]$
\item class 6: if the hourly wage  in year t $\in$ (hourly wage$^t_{max}/4$, hourly wage$^t_{max}/2]$
\item class 7: if the hourly wage  in year t $\in$ (hourly wage$^t_{max}/2$, hourly wage$^t_{max}]$
\end{itemize}

where hourly wage$^t_{max}$ represents the highest hourly wage in year $t$. It could be found that the individual class status should be indifferent no matter if we use real income level or not.

If the person's observed status is increased, s/he is considered to be promoted in our empirical analysis. 

\end{subsubsection}

\begin{subsubsection} {Basic Empirical Results}
First, we have to test one of the most important assumption in our model, where the promotion chances should be higher for those workaholics. We run the Linear Probability Model, Probit Model and Logit Model separately to test the efficiency of our assumption in Table (37).

In column 1 to column 3, we could find that all three models report positive influence of working hour towards to ratio of promotion. If we add education level into our regression in column 4 to 6 , we could find out the coefficient of working hour remain significantly positive while the effect of education, without any doubt, is positive. Finally, if we add linear and quadratic term of age into the regression, the t-stat for working hours decreases but is still significantly positive while the rest coefficients are exactly predicted by traditional Mincer earnings function.  It is proved our general assumption is reliable that working longer could help promotion. After considering the age effect, an additional 1,000 working hours per year will increase the promotion chances in the next year by 0.58\%.

Then we run several Mincer-type earning equations to briefly overview the panel data we have. The results are listed in Table (38). After controlling for the social status, the working hour is still positively related to the hourly nominal wage . However, from column (4) we find the effect of additional working hours on wage rate is insignificant if we take into account the unemployment hours in the regression. We don't run Heckman correction in this table and the result does not depress us that much. We can only argue that within those who suffer unemployment in one year the hardworking level has no significant effect on wage rate. At the same time, the unemployment itself is reported to have a negative effect on the wage ratio, which is consistent with our intuition since unemployment could send bad signals to employers. When the real wage is used as regressand, the working hour has a smaller positive influence on the real wage rate. We could explain the difference of working hour effect in column (1) to (4) and column (5) to (8) by the high inflation and the upward trend of working hours in the 1980s. That is to say, working more time will compensate a larger nominal hourly wage increase but a relatively smaller real wage enhancement measuring by dollars in 1975. Meanwhile, we could never fail to notice the return on education in column (6) and (7) are significantly negative, which could be the result of controlling for various status. Suppose person P1 and person P2 are in the same class level C but P1 has a relatively higher education level than P2, the education itself might send weaker signal of person P1 comparing to P2 since the effort for P2 to reach level C is much more challenging than P1 with a low starting point.  An additional 1,000 hours per year could increase the inflation-adjusted hourly compensation by 0.18 dollars measuring in 1975 dollars. The preliminary result is subject to endogeneity challenge but still pretty useful to understand the hour-wage relationship.

We also report the influence of working hour effect in Table (39) by using Heckman Correction. The independent variables we use in the first step Probit selection model are education, age (or experience), type of income and relationship to the head of the family. The very similar result  are reported in Table (38) whether we use Heckman Correction or not, suggesting the self-selected labor market participation decision (which is decided by education, age, type of income and family condition linearly in our approach) would not have a significant influence on the wage ratio. Also the standard robustness check are done by replacing age with working experience (exp) by using the following equation
\be
exp=age-edu-7
\ee
The result shows that although the coefficients of age and experience slightly differ, the sign does not change. The coefficient for working hours decreases only 2 \% when the age variable is replaced by experience, indicating a strong positive effect of working hour on the wage ratio.  

\end{subsubsection}

\begin{subsubsection} {Calibration for the social preference}

The next step is to calibrate the parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\eta$ and $\kappa$. First we use only the equation (24) to determine $\beta$ and $\gamma$. First we use the Federal fund rate from 1975 to 1993 as the risk-free return on asset $\mu_t$, which is appended in Table 18. With the lack of individual consumption data in PSID, we make a plausible assumption that the proportion of consumption in current income is steady between two continuous years. Although there is permanent income hypothesis claiming a person's consumption at a point is determined not just by their current income but also by their expected income in the future. 	Campbell, John Y., and N. Gregory Mankiw (1991) finds that the fraction of income accrues to individuals who consume their current income instead of their permanent income by testing the postwar data of US till 1990, which is consistent with our settings and data period. In this case, we could use inter-temporal relative income  as a good proxy of inter-temporal relative consumption. Also, we assume the leisure each year is calculated by the following equation by excluding 8 hours per day resting hour from the total allocatable time. Notice $5840=16*365$.
\be
leisure=5840-working \ hour
\ee

By using Euler Equation of consumption we can calibrate $\rho$ and $\gamma$.

% Please add the following required packages to your document preamble:

The instruments we use here in the Generalized Method of Moments is the one-year lag risk-free interest rate and social status, which by no means correlate with the variable we use in calibrating $\rho$ and $\gamma$. 
\begin{equation}
    E[U_c^t-\beta(1+\mu_t)U_c^{t+1}|r_{t-1}]=0
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

We could find that $\lambda < 1$. According to Raj Chetty (2005), the substitution effect dominates income effect as $\lambda<1.25$ threshold point, indicating a upward sloping labor supply curve for the PSID data from 1975-1992. The existing literature suggests $\lambda$ could vary from  0.15 to 1.45, indicating no out of expectation $\lambda$ value. The $\rho$ value here, however, is least important since the absolute weight of leisure could change with different unit measure of relative consumption and leisure. 

Then we re-estimate the value of $\gamma$ and $\rho$ by taking into account the social status influence. For $\textbf{Model 1}$,  equation (71) are included in the simultaneous equations. One-year and two-year lag risk-free interest rates are used as proxies for (71) to obtain two more moment conditions. And we should decide the $w_1$ first. We calibrate $w_1$ in each year from 1975 to 1992 by using the average income of the workers in first class, just as the original  setting in the firm sector .

\end{table}

Notice after we considering the embedded promotion option in equation (71), the calibrated relative risk aversion rate will increase a lot, but still less than 1.25 threshold indicated by Raj Chetty (2005), which points out that the substitution effect still dominates income effect even taking into account the promotion option value but a little bit weaker. In other word, the labor supply curve becomes even steeper, which could have a high slope than tradition belief. It could be the case that the standard expected utility function without promotion setup could fail to explain a higher relative risk aversion, which is consistent with Browning, Hansen, and Heckman (1999) suggesting $\lambda$ as high as 4. 

Then we shift to estimate the $\eta$ in \textbf{Model 2}. Focusing on equation (74), 
\be
A L^{e\ -\rho} +B L^{e\ 1-\rho}=D
\ee
Notice $A L^{e\ -\rho} << D$ and $A L^{e\ -\rho} << B L^{e\ 1-\rho}$, we should have the approximate equation
\be
B L^{e\ 1-\rho}=D
\ee
Together with the equation (67), we reach out the following calibration values by using the Generalized Method of Moment. In our model here, we use the one-period lagged interest rate, two-period lagged interest rate and one-period lagged promotion rate as instruments for equation (107) while the one-period lagged interest rate, two-period lagged interest rate and status are used as instruments for equation (67).

\end{table}

In this case, the estimated preference level of social status is $\exp (1.478234)*(1.610928-1)=2.679$.  Interestingly we find the relative risk aversion ratio $\gamma$ is quite large in this calibrated model, which contradicts the traditional belief that $\gamma<1.25$ in most labor economics literature. However, the large $\gamma$ does not generate a downward sloping labor supply curve in \textbf{Model 2} since there is additional utility gain from  social status which provides more incentive to substitute leisure with working hours. We could still argue the labor supply curve is upward sloping, being consistent with standard textbook conclusion. And with the inclusion of promotion variable, the relative risk aversion ratio could be higher than the standard assumption, which is exactly what some non-expected-utility theories argue.(Chew and MacCrimmon 1979, Tversky and Kahneman 1992).

In the next step we calibrate $\eta$ for each year during 1975 to 1992 to help us understand the change of preference on social status during these two decades.  The method we use is similar but in this part each year's data are treated as cross-sectional rather than panel.

The preference on the social status varies from 2.2 to 3.0 during 1975 to 1992, showing a relative high preference towards social status, which might contradict the general belief.  In the next figure we show the relative relationship between $\eta$ and annual working hours, nominal wage, inflation rate, real wage, respectively.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We could find when the preference for social status increases, the annual working hours also increases, which is consistent with our conclusion in \textbf{Proposition 10}. Meanwhile, the nominal wage rate increases while the real wage decreases at the same time. It might give us hint the preference for social status would increase just because of the high inflation. The employers are pushed to have a higher preference on status to catch up the inflation speed during the high inflation era. The relationship between inflation and social status preference could be a challenging research topic that deserves future works. 

It should be pointed out the approximation in equation (108) guarantees $\gamma$ should be no less than 1, indicating a higher than usual risk aversion level in the utility function. However, it does not lead to a downward sloping labor supply curve with high $\gamma$ since in our approach the positive taste for social status generates additional incentive for employees to work more. The existing literature in labor economics literature suggesting a low risk aversion ratio could be less convincing without taking into account other utility gains besides consumption and leisure. For instance, a higher rank in the society/corporation may provide a employee a first-class business trip, a special assistant and/or security service, which is never generally considered as personal consumption and is not recorded by the standard database like PSID. 
\end{susubbsection}

\begin{subsubsection}{Unemployment Influence}


The final thing in this section is to examine whether hard-working hurts the labor market by generating more unemployment. It could be expected that increasing working hours could decrease a person's unemployment time automatically. From Table (41) and Table (42) we could indeed confirm this conclusion. However, if we run the regression by each social class respectively, the statement that working more hours could significantly reduce unemployment time is true only for low-rank classes but not for high-rank employees. It might be explained that employees rely heavily on the working-hour as tools of making hiring decisions for junior workers while for seniors the self-selected hardworking level could not affect the unemployment level. That is to say, the assumption in my approach assuming self-selecting working hour as ability signal might not remain valid for high-rank employees. We might use other assumptions to depict the hiring decisions for high-rank employees and the matching model for entrepreneurs could differ a lot. 

Meanwhile we examine whether the working hour has a significant influence on the unemployment the year after. The result is reported in Table (42) and Table (43). Instead of  the real working hour, current year's unemployment hour could be a good predictor of next year's unemployment situation, which gives us hint that the unemployment could be lasting. The rest of the result is quite similar to Table (40) and Table (41). Therefore, we could reach an educated guess that working overtime under various preference on social status might not increase the unemployment, which could be inconsistent with our naive expected results. The social status preference, however, influences the intensive margin greater than extensive margin more significantly.





\end{subsubsection}


\begin{subsubsection}{Discussion of the PSID data}
The biggest advantage of using PSID dataset is that it could be used as panel tracking on the same cohort for a long time. In this case, it is possible for us the depict the social status preference consistently. However, we could still fail to neglect the potential weakness of using PSID database. 

The first weakness is that PSID does not record the aggregate level of consumption. It adds additional difficulty when we have to estimate the consumption in aggregation level, which creates additional measurement errors. The first treatment is to use food consumption/garbage generation (A Savov 2011) in some particular years as proxies of overall consumption. However, the Engel Coefficients/garbage generation between the poor and the rich, the person who has a high social preference and the the person with a lower one could be totally different, which makes the consumption level estimates unconvincing. Also PSID does not record the food consumption for each year, adding more difficulties of using food consumption to estimate the overall consumption. Consequently,  we make the rational assumption that inter-temporal relative income could be used a good proxy of inter-temporal relative consumption despite the widely-believed permanent income hypothesis. 

 Secondly, PSID uses a top coding rule for protecting the private information of the rich. For instance, in the year 1992 all the salary income greater than 999,999 dollars are reported as 999,999 dollars. It is a mechanism to protect the high-income responders' incentive to participate the survey more actively but create biases for our conclusion. Since the top coding strategy is treated as an up-censored model, the real incentive for promotion could be underestimate, particularly for high-rank employees. As a result, I am strongly convinced that the preference for social-status preference should be overestimated since the pecuniary marginal utility is underestimated by using PSID database. A possible robustness check is to use other panel database like National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) to test the validity of the various preference on social status and other non-pecuniary factors, which is still beyond current research and deserves future work.

\begin{subsection}{Concluding Remarks}
It is the time to answer the three questions raised at the beginning of this article. Indeed different social status preference could have a significant impact on work-leisure choices. In our benchmark model, social status is considered to be non-pecuniary normal good. The substitution effect will dominate income effect for the employee with high rank preference level, which leads to a longer working hour. They work more time even  overtime a lot, sending their strong-ability signals to employees not only to increase their potential salary income after promotion but the utility level with a higher social status. The signaling effect is tested to be weaker for high-rank positions. The working hour will increase with respect to the relative output elasticities between labor and capital input. As a result, it is widely observed that workers in developing economies tend to work overtime more frequently than in developed countries. The leisure time will be less if the median worker is fond of a higher rank position. In other word, if the preference for social status is higher inside one corporation, the leisure time will be occupied with working with higher probabilities. We could observe the working overtime phenomenon in Asian companies since most workers are educated to surpass others in their early age. \textit{For instance, many students are educated to be man on top of man in those Confucian-dominated culture.} In this case, the rational choice is to work more and consume less leisure. For instance, an Asian kid is typically educated that Peking University, Tsinghua Universiy, Seoul National University, Tokyo University, IIT, Harvard, MIT, Stanford are the only choices of college education, which going without saying increases the working load for teenagers. However, the utility level might be lower with a strong preference on relative ranking\footnote{In \textbf{Model 4}, it is depicted as  a higher $\kappa$ value}. An economy with higher preference on relative ranking should have a faster growth rate while the self-identified utility level of each individual could be lower. They tend to believe that the utility level is negative no matter how high are the consumption and leisure level\footnote{ In \textbf{Model 4}, if the social status is lower than $\kappa  \bar{S}$ the utility level is negative.} if they can fail to surpass their peers. In other word, they become extremely exhausted chasing high social ranks although they are compensated with higher consumption level.  Finally, we find no significant evidence that high social preference and working overtime will lead to an increasing unemployment level.  There is still a long way to go to examine the culture's influence on labor market decisions. For instance, we could test the validity of our conclusion using other US or developing countries databases, which could be a challenging topic for future research.

\subsection{Appendix}
\textbf{Proof of Proposition 2.} 
For the simultaneous inequalities 
\be \label{PP2A}
\sum_{i=1}^k (\f{1}{\lambda})^{i-1}  \f{1}{i} n_1=N 
\ee
\be \label{PP2B}
 (\f{1}{\lambda})^{k-1} \f{1}{k} n_1 \geq1 
\ee
\be  \label{PP2C}
(\f{1}{\lambda})^k \f{1}{k+1} n_1 <1 
\ee
If we assume when $N$ increase to $N+1$, $k_{N+1}<k_N$. Notice $k$ is decided by (\ref{PP2B}) and (\ref{PP2C}) . Then $n_{1, N+1}<n_{1, N}$. Then in (\ref{PP2A}), we should have 
\be
\begin{split}
\sum_{i=1}^{k_{N+1}} (\f{1}{\lambda})^{i-1}  \f{1}{i} n_{1,N+1}  & \leq  \sum_{i=1}^{k_{N}} (\f{1}{\lambda})^{i-1}  \f{1}{i} n_{1,N+1} \\ & < \sum_{i=1}^{k_{N}} (\f{1}{\lambda})^{i-1}  \f{1}{i} n_{1,N}  \\ &= N
\end{split}
\ee
It leads to contradiction. So $k_{N+1} \geq k_N$.

Also if assume when $\lambda$ increase to $\lambda'$, $k_{\lambda'}>k_{\lambda}$. Notice $k$ is decided by (\ref{PP2B}) and (\ref{PP2C}) Then $n_{1, \lambda'}>n_{1, \lambda}$. Since the promotion difficulties increases and the number of class also increases, we should have for each rank, 
\be
(\f{1}{\lambda'})^{i-1} \f{1}{i} n_{1,\lambda'} \geq (\f{1}{\lambda})^{i-1} \f{1}{i} n_{1,\lambda}
\ee
And
\be
\begin{split}
\sum_{i=1}^{k_{\lambda'}} (\f{1}{\lambda'})^{i-1}  \f{1}{i} n_{1,\lambda'}  & \geq  \sum_{i=1}^{k_\lambda} (\f{1}{\lambda'})^{i-1}  \f{1}{i} n_{1,\lambda'} +(\f{1}{\lambda'})^{k_\lambda} \f{1}{k_\lambda+1} n_{1,\lambda'}\\ & \geq \sum_{i=1}^{k_\lambda} (\f{1}{\lambda})^{i-1}  \f{1}{i} n_{1,\lambda}+(\f{1}{\lambda'})^{k_\lambda} \f{1}{k_\lambda+1} n_{1,\lambda'} \\ & >N
\end{split}
\ee
It leads to contradiction. So $k_{\lambda'} \leq k_{\lambda}$. \qed
\\
\textbf{Proof of Proposition 8.}\\
Let 
\be 
p=\f{S}{2(S+1)\lambda}
\ee 
Notice 
\be
\f{\p  p }{\p S}>0
\ee
Take the total differential of (\ref{M2A}), we should have
\be
\f{\eta S^{\eta-1}}{\beta (1+\mu)} dS +\f{S^\eta}{1+\mu} (-\f{1}{\beta^2}) d\beta =\f{\p p}{\p S} (S+1)^\eta dS +p\eta (S+1^{\eta-1}) dS + (1-p) S^{\eta-1} dS- \f{\p p}{\p S} S^\eta dS
\ee
We have
\be
\f{dS}{d\beta}=\f{\f{S^\eta}{1+\mu}  (-\f{1}{\beta^2})}{((S+1)^\eta-S^\eta)\f{\p p}{\p S} + (p\eta (S+1)^{\eta-1}+(1-p) S^{\eta-1} -\f{\eta S^{\eta-1}}{\beta(1+\mu)} ) } <0
\ee
since 
\be
((S+1)^\eta-S^\eta)\f{\p p}{\p S}>0
\ee
thus
\be
(p\eta (S+1)^{\eta-1}+(1-p) S^{\eta-1} -\f{\eta S^{\eta-1}}{\beta(1+\mu)} ) >(1-p) S^{\eta-1} -\f{\eta S^{\eta-1}}{\beta(1+\mu)} >0
\ee
when $1-p>\f{5}{6}>\f{\eta}{\beta(1+\mu)} $ in our later approach

 \qed


\textbf{Proof of Proposition 10.}\\
Take the total differential of (\ref{M2B}).
\be
-\rho A L^{e\ -\rho-1} dL +L^{e\ 1-\rho} dB +(1-\rho) B L^{-\rho} dL=0
\ee
We have 
\be
\f{dL}{dB}=\f{L^{e\ 1-\rho}}{\rho A L^{e\ -\rho-1}-(1-\rho) B L^{e\ -\rho}} >0
\ee
since $A>0$ and $B<0$  if $\gamma <1$ \\
Notice $\f{\p B}{\p \eta}<0$ we have $\f{\p L^e}{\p \eta}<0$  \qed

\begin{section} {Chapter 3: The Institutional and Political Influence on Prosperity}

\begin{subsection}{Introduction}
To the unease of believers of ideal societies, evidence of political power prevails in all communities, be it small or large, rich or poor, capitalism or socialism. Political power exists in all forms, such as lobbying, media control, bribery, nepotism and even the choice of regime. Within a country, the discrepancy in political capital among economic participants can affect their behavior and the pattern of their interaction, thus affecting structural evolution of the country; meanwhile, the institutional difference among different countries would create distinct evolution patterns for market participants subject to their political capital discrepancy. This paper focuses on the impact of political capital discrepancy and institutional difference on corporate behavior and market evolution. To be specific, we examined how the difference among nations' institutions (democracy or authoritarian), the efficacy of company's political power and relative political status of companies would affect firm's resource allocation between human capital and political capital investment.

Essentially there are tight link between human capital and economic growth. It is concluded that human capital is associated with knowledge and skills, contributing to economic development that depends on advances in technological and scientific knowledge. (Gary S. Becker, Kevin M. Murphy, and Robert Tamura 1994). Barro (1989) studies the education impact on per capita level growth among approximate 100 countries and proposes the argument that human capital investment plays a pivotal role in subsequent economic growth. It has been found (Romer 1989) that initial literacy level has no additional explanatory power on growth rates on investment but help predict the
subsequent rate of investment and economic development.

With the development of Corruption Perceptions Index, it is now easier to find the empirical relationship between corruption and economic development. In empirical studies conducted by Pellegrini and Gerlagh (2004), corruption has been found to have a negative effect on economic growth. Corruption is also studied as case studies for various countries, such as Vietnam, South Korea and Philippines, Italy and many others. When it comes to democratic and market-oriented economies, government intervention in the economy is often referred to as rent seeking activities. Krueger (1974) discusses the ways where rent seeking is competitive. Following Bentley's pioneering work (1908) and stimulated by Stigler (1975), Peltzman and Posner (1974), Becker (1983) build a model of political competition among pressure groups. Under political equilibrium, all groups--defined by occupation, industry, income, geography and other characteristics--maximize their incomes by spending their optimal amount on political pressure, given the productivity of their expenditures and the behavior of other groups. Indeed, the interference of government in the economy are not pervasive in all societies for no reason. Market participants face the dilemma of seeking political support or investing in its core competency despite the institutional difference of countries. If we carefully consider these institutional difference among nations, does the difference between the process of ``rent seeking'' which describes a money-dominated bidding process, and the process of ``corruption'' which depicts a subtle and more complicated efforts, have the same or different implications on economic development? Our answer is different, depending on the country's political institutions. 

Now let's treat political advantages as one type of asset called ``political capital'' similar to human capital, regardless of which channel the participants acquire the advantages. In a world that's not perfectly free (i.e. affected by political power), relative abundance of political capital can yield extra income to a group in forms such as subsidies, free licences, tax exemptions, preferential policies, etc.; on the contrary, lack of political capital often leads to losses to the group of interest, and the losses in many occasions are not as financially explicit, such as more red tapes in licensing process, stricter regulations and restrictions on qualifications and harsh finance environment. Although political capital itself does not enhance productivity, a group's comparative abundance or deficiency in political capital can boost or hurt its profitability as well as its business strategy. In our model following the work of Ehrlich and Lui (1999), political capital partially redistributes the income of the society without affecting the total output of all entities. 

To define the institutional difference among nations, we find the recent work \textit{``why nations fail''} by Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) provides a helpful framework. They argue that political institutions can be divided into two kinds - \textit{``extractive''} institutions in which a ``small" group of individuals do their best to exploit - in the sense of Marx - the rest of the population, and \textit{``inclusive''} institutions in which ``many'' people are included in the process of governing hence the exploitation process is either attenuated or absent. While they successfully apply their reasoning to most of the nations, they dodge the question that why countries such as Singapore, where only a few people are included in the process of governing, succeed. Their argument is that countries that have extractive institutions cannot sustain long-term economic growth even if they can experience a short-term rapid growth. In our model, we translate the inclusiveness of institutions as how easy it is to accumulate political power and impose this power to gain economic benefits. The result of our model provides a strong and effective amendment to Acemoglu and Robinson's theories where we have explained the East Asia's ``success'' which is a phenomenon that can maintain its stability.

For nations with inclusive institutions, political capital usually accumulates through lobbying, media control and advocacy, all of which are generally considered ``competitive rent seeking''; while for nations with extractive institutions, political capital is usually acquired through more interpersonal interactions such as bribery, nepotism and political marriages. The difference, however, cannot always be measured quantitatively since the implicit cost of many behaviors could not be monetized. However, all behaviors above take efforts and time from the economic participants, and can be measured in the sense of the opportunity cost behind those efforts seeking political advantages. For example, an agent in an inclusive economy chooses to hire lobbyists at the cost of giving up investment in research and development using the same amount of resource; on the other hand, an agent in an extractive economy spend time and effort to build relationship with the ones in power by letting go the chances to attract more employees of high capacity and improve the efficiency of business. For economic participants in nations of whichever institutions, they are always weighing the costs and benefits from investing between political capital and human capital (and other investments that can improve productivity of their businesses). Therefore the percentage of all resources available (monetary or non-monetary including time, efforts and other expenditures) invested in human capital and political capital can be taken as the decisions made from this weighing and balancing all direct and indirect trade-offs. 

With the concept of opportunity cost in mind, Isaac Ehrlich, Francis Lui (1999) develop two complementary models to demonstrate the endogenous development of corruption and growth. Their paper makes a significant contribution by introducing time constraint imposed on individuals considering resource allocation to human capital or political capital. In addition, they assume that corruption affects individuals' income by creating an add-on profit or loss to individuals' production income depending on their relative political capital stock, which is contrary to the common belief that corruption imposes a social cost to all participants. These two assumptions lay a solid theoretical foundation for the model we develop in this paper. Different from Ehrlich and Lui (1999), this paper applies the same assumptions to a corporate setting and instead of maximizing the utility from an infinite consumption stream, the corporate agent maximizes its discounted inter-temporal profit level in this paper. 

The conclusion from Ehrlich and Lui's paper is intriguing where they deduce three equilibrium in both of their homogeneous and heterogeneous agents cases: low-level stagnant equilibrium (poverty trap), stagnant ``development'' equilibrium and persistent ``growth'' equilibrium. The crucial difference among these three equilibrium stages is the investment in human capital, which is considered as the engine of economy's growth. In fact, Adam Smith in \textit{``the Wealth of Nation''} wrote down the very first sentence, \textit{``The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labor, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgement with which it is anywhere directed or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labor.''} In our model, we use the investment in human capital as the proxy to discuss the growth of nations.

The reallocation of resource due to varying political capital was discussed in various forms. Song, Storesletten and Zilibotti (2011) have constructed a two-sector model to explain the coexistence of high growth, high return to capital and a growing foreign surplus in China's economic transformation. By demonstrating the reallocation of capital and labor from less productive externally financed firms to more productive entrepreneurial firms who have less access to external financing, Song implies that less productive firms have comparatively more political capital which grants them easier access to financing resources. In reality, political capital varies widely since political power can exist in a great variety of forms besides state-ownership, making it sometimes difficult to classify them into binary categories-less productive externally financed firms and more productive internally financed firms: first, the percentage of equity owned by government (state or local government) can vary from single digits to 100\%; second, productive private enterprise may choose to hire relatives of government officials, invite people who are politically powerful on the company's board, or get around with government interference with other tactics in order to be favoured by the bureaucrats and receive ``income transfer'' from political advantages; third, the level of political capital can vary across time for companies who change their resource allocation strategy (e.g. political capital v.s. human capital) in different time frames. In our model, the political status of firms vary continuously throughout history and political advantages impose on a company based on its relative political capital stock rather than absolute capital stock. In other words, the political status of a firm needs to be ranked with its peers to see how much political capital is accumulated in this firm compared with other firms who are also competing for political preference by resource allocation to political endeavors.

For a specific economy, companies' capacity to accumulate political capital and influence policy making might result in different resource allocation strategy, depending on whether the company is in an economy with extractive or inclusive institutions. The debate of what kind of institutions foster or hinder economic growth has been going on for a long time. Przeworski and Limongi (1993) have summarized the debate on democracy, where they attach an interesting table showing the findings in about twenty papers, all holding different opinions on what level of democracy or authoritarian yields fastest growth. The impact of political institutions on corporates’ political activity has not been discussed as much. In as early as 1986, Useem’s book ``The inner circle: Large corporations and the rise of business political activity in the US and UK'' expressed concerns to the rising political activity from large enterprises. Hillman, Zardkoohi and Bierman (1999) have found  clear  evidence  of  a  positive  relationship between  one  type  of  political  strategy,  personal service,  and  firm  performance. Hansen and Mitchell (2000) has examined the political activities of Fortune 500 firms, along with an oversampling of U.S. affiliates of large foreign investors for the 1987 to 1988 election cycle. Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo, and Snyder (2003) has argued that political contributions should not be  viewed  as  investment  in  the  political  process  but merely as a form of consumption good. Milyo, Primo, and Groseclose (2000) have shown that large political action committee contributors spend 20 to 60 times more on lobbying expenses than they do on hard money contributions. Cooper, Gulen and Ovtchinnikov (2009) have documented a strong and robust positive correlation between firms’ political contribution practices and their future abnormal returns, and it is likely that only large firms can afford to pay these political contributions. Their findings are partially confirmed in our modeling where we found large companies tend to invest more in political capital only in inclusive institutions. The case for extractive institutions, however, is more complicated, which will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

The literature regarding the impact of political institutions on division of labor is relatively limited. The inspiring work of Becker (1994) \textit{``The Division of Labor, Coordination Costs, and Knowledge''} discusses how specialization and the division of labor depend on coordination costs, and also on the amount and extent of knowledge. He also comments that \textit{``Countries with lower coordination costs due to stabler and more efficient laws, or other reasons, not only have larger outputs, but they also tend to grow faster because lower cost stimulate investments in knowledge by raising the advantages of a more extensive division of labor.''} without specifying how the ``stabler and more efficient laws'' takes effect on the coordination costs. This institutional effect is studied more closely by Yang and Sachs (2003). They theorize that the delimitation and protection of property rights is the ultimate driver of labor division.  

The remaining sections of this article are organized as follows. Section 2 builds the benchmark model and discusses the case without political intervention. Section 3 shows three different equilibrium cases under various exogenous conditions of parameters. Section 4 provides detailed case studies to help understand why some nations succeed while others fail and section 5 concludes the whole article. The most remarkable contribution of this article is that it originally points out there exists an alternative way towards long-term economic prosperity other than political and economic intuitions being intrinsic at the same time.  


\end{subsection}


\begin{subsection}{Equilibrium under no political intervention}
In this section we build an infinite-period heterogeneous agent model. Each company in the framework attempts to maximize its discounted intertemporal profit level.

\be
\max \sum_{t=0}^\infty \f{1}{(1+r_t)^t}P_t^i, \forall i
\ee
where $r_t$ is the t-year yield rate and $P_t^i$ represents profit level for agent $i$ in period t. Here for simplicity at the very beginning we assume each agent faces homogeneous credit constraints and discounted rate so that $r_t$ only relies on $t$ but not $i$. Later we will relax the homogeneous discount rate assumption and unveil the dynamic equilibrium under more general assumptions.

The profit is endogenously determined in each period with the engine of human capital accumulation. Following Isaac Ehrlich, Francis Lui (1999)'s approach, we assume the human capital is decided by
\be
H^i_{t+1}=A (\bar{H}^i+H^i_t) h^i_t
\ee
where $H^i_t$ means human capital endowment is period $t$ for company $i$. $h^i_t$ denotes fraction of time spent on acquiring human capital in period $t$ for agent $i$ and $A$ human-capital-augmenting technology coefficient. $\bar{H}^i$ here, however, denotes raw human capital capacity such as manual labor for $i^{th}$ agent, which can be obtained without any human capital obtaining effort . For instance, people who possess raw human capital only should be able to accomplish simple task like housekeeping and mowing.

Meanwhile, there exists a second type of capital, say political capital in this framework, which is generated by
\be
Q^i_{t+1}=B(\lambda \bar{H}^i+Q^i_t) q^i_t
\ee

where $Q^i_t$ denotes political capital and $q^i_t$ the fraction of time spent on investing political capital accumulation for agent $i$ at time $t$. $B$ is the political accessibility coefficient, which denotes fairness and openness of the public policy decision-making process. A higher $B$ represents a more inclusive political institution. Raw labor with a multiplier $\lambda$ is also introduced into the function of political capital accumulation, which is consistent with a reasonable assumption that the company with more people should have a large capacity of political endowment. Examples of political capitals could vary under different political and economic institutions (see Acemoglu (2012)'s definition of intrinsic and extractive intuition). For instance, political capital includes lobbying power, dominance of media, political contributions for countries with intrinsic institutions. On the contrary, for extractive intuitions, bribery amount, the relationship with political entity leaders or dictators could be widely regarded as political capital. In our framework, political capital plays a crucial role in realized profit function through output redistribution while human capital affects profit function through contribution to higher technology efficiency.

Without loss of generality, total time endowment within one period is set as 1 for all agents. Consequently, the remaining time for company $i$ to do production in period $t$ is calculated as
\be
e_t^i=1-h_t^i-q_t^i
\ee
and the raw profit is set by
\be
Y_t^i=C (\bar{H}^i+H_t^i)e_t^t
\ee
where $Y_t^i$ is the raw profit level and C represents Hicks-neutral technological progress.

The realized profit is as follows.
\be
P_t^i =Y_t^i [1+\theta \ln(\f{Q^i_t}{Q_t^*})]
\ee
where $\theta$ denotes the political influential level, which is the amount under government intervention and regulation. In a hypothetical society with government intervention level $\theta=0$, it is intuitive and straightforward that each agent will choose $q^i_t=0, \forall i, t$ since acquiring political capital is nothing but wastes of time contributing to discounted profit level. $Q_t^*$ denotes political beneficiary threshold , which is the median political capital level with zero realized government intervention gain or loss. Agents with stronger political power $Q^i_t>Q_t$ are accompanied by positive subsidies or transferring income. On the contrary, $Q^i_t<Q_t$ denotes a net loss. I will raise two examples under intrinsic and extractive intuitions, respectively, to illustrate the economic implication of $\theta$. (1) In the countries with intrinsic intuitions, a restaurant chain company could donate an increasing amount of political contributions to support senators or representatives favoring low sales taxes. Once the Act of reducing tax rate is passed, they will be the beneficiary of both increased sales and less tax obligation. (2) The corresponding example in those extractive countries is a different story. The restaurant company could bribe the bureaucrats in food regulation department. The bureaucrats, therefore, will be reluctant to issue restaurant license to its competitors or simply fine heavily the competitors under some unreasonable excuse such as ``low food quality" or ``unqualified sanitary condition" even for highly-qualified restaurant competitors.

Since it is a close economy, the aggregate political redistribution gain for companies with $Q^i >Q^*$ should be equal to the aggregate loss suffering by agents with $Q^i < Q^*$. 
\be
\sum_i Y_t^i=\sum_i P_t^i=\sum_i Y_t^i [1+\theta \ln \frac{Q_t^i}{Q_t^*}], \forall t
\ee
And the median political capital level $Q_t^*$ is also determined by the above equation. For instance, if all agents have the same raw profit level $Y_t^i$ and the distribution of political capital follows log-normal distribution $\ln N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, the $Q_t^*$ will be exactly $e^\mu$ since $\ln \frac{Q_t^i}{Q_t^*}$ remains symmetric.

The Ehrlich \& Lui's (1997) framework makes similar assumptions on the consumption function, but it suffers from the following weakness and could be eliminated in our firm-level profit-based approach. Firstly, with $\theta$ high enough, those agents with low political capital should have a negative profit level during that particular period, which is consistent and ubiquitous in those developing economies. However, in Ehrlich \& Lui's (1997) approach, their model did not wipe out the possibilities of a negative consumption level,  leading to inappropriate and unconvincing conclusion. Secondly, it is more rational to assume that profits instead of consumptions suffer from linear-form extraction gain/loss. The linear tax-consumption relationship is not consistent with permanent income hypothesis while in our approach the linear-type tax-profit approach is in conform with the hypothesis.

The state variables in this framework are $H_t^i$ and $Q_t^i$ and choice variables are $h_t^i$ and $q_t^i$, for $i \in I$ and $t=0,1,...$. Consequently, we could have the following two Euler Equations.

\be
e_{t+1}^i =\frac{(1+r_{t+1})(1+\theta \ln \frac{Q_t^i}{Q_t^*})}{A (1+\theta \ln \frac{Q_{t+1}^i}{Q_{t+1}^*})}
\ee
and
\be
\frac{\bar{H}^i+H_t^i}{\bar{H}^i+H_{t+1}^i} = \frac{\theta Q_{t+1}^* B (\lambda \bar{H}^i+Q_t^i)}{A  (1+\theta \ln \frac{Q_{t+1}^i}{Q_{t+1}^*})}
\ee

Where $H_{t+1}^i=A(\bar{H}^i+H_t)h_t$   
We have reach out the policy function of determining $h_t$ if the politically influential level $\theta >0$
\be
h_t^i=\frac{\frac{X_{t+1}^i}{\bar{H}^i+H_t^i}-\bar{H}^i}{A(\bar{H}^i+H_t^i)}
\ee
Where 
\be
X_{t+1}^i=\frac{\theta Q_{t+1}^* B (\lambda \bar{H}^i+Q_t^i)}{A  (1+\theta \ln \frac{Q_{t+1}^i}{Q_{t+1}^*})}
\ee
The economic meaning of those two policy functions is intuitive. The marginal profit gain from production alone should be equal to the discounted marginal profit gain for investing in human capital for the future periods, which itself is equivalent to the discounted marginal profit obtaining political capital to seek additional tax bracket/income transfer gain and/or avoid redistribution penalty loss. 

If there did not exist government fiscal policy or any business intervention, $\theta=0$. In this case we will have only one policy function with respect to human capital investment choice. It is meaningless to invest any political capital as the marginal profit contribution of political capital is nothing but negative number. In this case,
\be
h_{t+1}^i=1-\frac{1+r_{t+1}}{A}, \forall t
\ee

(i) Equilibrium I: no human capital accumulation.
Notice the natural constraint $0\leq h_t \leq 1$. When $A\leq 1+r_t$, the rational choice of human capital investment $h_t=0$, denoting a zero human-capital-accumulation economy.  The human capital technology level remains at a low level so that the raw labor production efficiency outweighs human capital investment, leading a stagnant economic growth situation. Assuming flat interest rate term structure $r_t \equiv r$, the value of a corporate is fully determined by the initial raw human capital endowment, say $\bar{H}^i$.
\be 
V(\bar{H}^i)=\sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{C\bar{H}^i }{(1+r)^t} =\frac{C\bar{H}^i (1+r)}{r}
\ee
which is quite similar to the traditional discount cash flow pricing model.

(ii) Equilibrium II: Decreasing human capital growth. 

In this case, we assume $1+r_t<A<2 r_t$.
By assuming initial political capital endowment $H_0=\bar{H}^i$ and flat term-structure $r_t \equiv r, \forall t$, we have $H_{t+1}=A(\bar{H}+H_t)(1-\frac{1+r_t}{A})$. The human capital for each period is calculated as 
\be
H_t^i= \frac{\bar{H}^i \left((2 A-2 r-3) (A-r-1)^t-A+r+1\right)}{A-r-2}, \forall t
\ee
The value for an agent with intial human capital $\bar{H}$ under flat term structure $r_t \equiv r, \forall t$ is
\be
\begin{aligned}
V(\bar{H}) &= \sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(1+r)^t} P_t\\ &=\sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{C (r+1)^{1-t} \left(\frac{\bar{H} \left((2 A-2 r-3)
   (A-r-1)^t-A+r+1\right)}{A-r-2}+\bar{H}\right)}{A} \\ &= \frac{C \bar{H} (r+1)^2 (2 r+1)}{A r (2 (r+1)-A)}
\end{aligned}
\ee

The value of the stock is a finite number with human capital $H_t$ decreasing each period by approximately $1-(A-1-r) $ (where $A-1-r$ is less than 1) percent.

From the expression of the agent value, we could derive without difficulty that $\frac{\partial V(\bar{H})}{\partial \bar{H}}>0$, meaning stock value increases with a large initial (raw) human capital. From this point of view, corporation with initial larger number of workers should be accompanied by a larger share price. $\frac{\partial V(\bar{H})}{\partial C}=constant>0$, representing linear positive contribution of Hicks-neutral technology progress.

Meanwhile, the marginal share price on human-capital-accumulating technology progress is positive. 
\be
\frac{d V}{d A}=\frac{2 C \bar{H} (r+1)^2 (2 r+1) (A-r-1)}{A^2 r (A-2 (r+1))^2} >0
\ee

Although a higher $A$ could lower current proportion of production, the investment on future human capital accumulation contributes positively to the aggregate discounted profit level with a higher production efficiency for the periods after.

At the same time, the second derivative with respect to A is also positive.
\be
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^2 V}{d A^2} &=& -\frac{2 C \bar{H} (r+1)^2 (2 r+1) \left(3 A^2-6 A (r+1)+4 (r+1)^2\right)}{A^3 r (A-2 (r+1))^3} \\
&=&-\frac{2 C \bar{H} (r+1)^2 (2 r+1) \left( 3(A-(1+r))^2+(r+1)^2   \right)}{A^3 r (A-2 (r+1))^3} >0
\end{aligned}
\ee

The positive second-level differential means the human-capital accumulation technology progress can accelerate intrinsic value of a firm. This result explains why human capital enhancing technology plays a more productive role than production technology in boosting share values. Besides contribution to production efficiency, human capital accumulation technology itself, such as a faster self-studying search engine like Google or an efficient online learning platform like Coursera, could lift future human capital accumulation speed, resulting in even higher production technology. In the field of theoretical physics, Albert Einstein, standing on the accomplishment of Newton's theoretical framework, was able to step forward to make the world-changing contribution by developing the theory of relativity.



Similar to the traditional model, $\frac{\partial V}{\partial r} <0$ and $\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial r^2}>0$ (proof is in the appendix A1 \& A2), indicating a diminishing firm value with respect to increase in interest rate at a decreasing scale. A high interest hurts the value of a corporation through not only decreasing the present value of future profit, but reducing the incentive for future human capital investment. 

(iii) Equilibrium III: Increasing human capital growth with finite share value.
This equilibrium happens when $2+r<A<2(1+r)$. Most of the properties in Equilibrium III is the same as Equilibrium II. The only difference is that the human capital accumulation growth rate is positive for each period, which is still slower than the growth of interest discount rate ($(1+r)^t$), forming a finite company share price.


(iv) Equilibrium IV:  Increasing human capital growth with unbounded share price.

When human capital technology is high enough, i.e. $A\geq 2(1+r)$, $S(\bar{H})=\infty$. This is equivalent to the case $g>r$ in the discounted cash flow with growth model. In this case, the approximate growth rate for human capital and profit level are $A-1-r$, which even exceed the interest discount rate ($(1+r)^t$), yielding an infinite share price.

Figure 1 reflects the relationship between firm value, human-capital-augmenting technology and interest rate when we normalizing $C=1$ and $\bar{H}=1$. Figure 2 shows the case when interest rate equals 0.25 to provide a sectional view of share value. There is a sudden jump at the threshold point $A=1.25$ when shifting from Equilibrium I to Equilibrium II. Surpassing the critical point switches the economic growth pattern from producing with raw labor to human capital accumulation.  Figure 3 shows the case of $A=1.5$ how firm value diminishes with interest rate at a decreasing scale.

\begin{subsection} {Equilibrium under political intervention}

Now we switch to the case when the politically influential coefficient $\theta$ is not zero. Different from Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson's dichotomous definition of intrinsic and extractive institution, $B$ and $\theta$ depict institutional differences through continuous function. While, it is without any controversies that North Korea accounts for extractive institutions while the South is intrinsic, it is hard to judge without any ambiguity whether Thailand's institution is intrinsic or not. Allowing continuous changes leave more room for picturing differences between countries' regimes.

Define $S_t^i=\frac{Q_t^i}{Q_t^*}$ as the relative social status for agent $i$ in period $t$. In the steady state of $h_t^i$ and $q_t^i$ under constant inter-temporal relative social status assumption, we have the following equilibrium conditions.

\be
h^i_e+q^i_e=\frac{A-(1+r)}{A}
\ee
and
\be
\frac{\bar{H}^i+H^i_t}{\bar{H}^i+A(\bar{H}^i+H^i_t)h^i_e}=\frac{\theta Q_{t+1}^* B(\lambda \bar{H}^i+Q_t^*S_e^i)}{A(1+\theta \ln S_e^i)}
\ee
where $h_e^i$, $q_e^i$, $e_e^i$, $S_e^i$ are the steady state of $h_t^i$, $q_t^i$, $e_t^i$, $S_t^i$ respectively. And a flat term structure $r_t \equiv r$ is assumed. Let
$ \tau =\mathrm{argmin}_t \ h_t^i, q_t^i, e_t^i, S_t^i$ all enter steady state. With the recurrence definition of $H_t^i$ and $Q_t^i$ the following expressions can be reached out.
\be
H_t^i=(H_\tau^i +\frac{A \bar{H}^i h_e^i}{A h_e^i-1}) (A h _e^i)^{t-\tau} - \frac{A \bar{H}^i h_e^i}{A h_e^i-1}
\ee
and
\be
Q_t^i=(Q_\tau^i+ \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_e^i}{B q_e^i -1}) (B q_e^i) ^{t-\tau} - \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_e^i}{B q_e^i -1}
\ee
There exists three cases under the natural constraint of $A \geq 1+r$ 

(i) Equilibrium I. (Stagnant human capital accumulation where $H_t$ cannot grow)\\
When $A\leq 2+r$, we have $h_e^i<\frac{1}{A}$, ie.  $A h_e^i <1$. In this case $h_t^i$ keeps decreasing with respect to $t$ and consequently the steady state human capital accumulation $h_e^i=0$ and $H^e_i=0$. With equation (19) we could have $Q_{t+1}^*$ is also at its steady state $Q_e^*$, where $Q_e^*$ is the median agent's equilibrium political capital and $\bar{H}$ is the median agent's initial raw human capital endowment.
\be
\frac{\theta Q_e^* B(\lambda \bar{H}+Q_e^*)}{A}=1
\ee
So we reach out the expression of $Q_e^*$
\be
Q_e^*= \frac{-\theta B \lambda \bar{H}+\sqrt{(\theta B \lambda \bar{H})^2 +4 A\theta B}}{2 \theta B}
\ee
where
\be
q_e^*=\frac{Q_e^*}{B \lambda \bar{H}+B Q_e^*}
\ee
under the condition 
\be
\frac{1}{q_e^*} \leq \frac{A-1-r}{A}
\ee
ie
\be
A>\frac{1+r}{1-q^i_e}
\ee
It is straightforward to show that the relative social status of agent $i$ in each period is the ratio of raw human capital $\bar{H}^i$ for $i^{th}$ company to median raw human capital endowment $\bar{H}$.
\be
S_0^i=S_1^i=...=S_e^i=...=\frac{\bar{H}^i}{\bar{H}}
\ee

with $Q^i_0=\lambda \bar{H}^i$ and $Q_{t+1}^i=B(\lambda \bar{H}^i +Q_t^i) q_e^i = B(\lambda \bar{H}^i +Q_t^i) q_e^i=- \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_e^i}{B q_e^i -1} $ for $\forall t \geq \tau$.


We could show that $\frac{d q_e^*}{d \theta} < 0$ (in the Appendix A3). Recalling $\theta$ denotes marginal redistribution power between different social status, the equilibrium time effort to accumulate political capital decreases with $\theta$ increases when there are no human capital accumulation.

In this case, the after-redistribution profit is 
\be
P_t^i=C\bar{H}^i (1-q_e^i) (1+\theta \ln \frac{\bar{H}^i}{\bar{H}})
\ee
and the share value for the median company under stagnant equilibrium when entering the steady state is 
\be
V_\theta (\bar{H})=\sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{C\bar{H}^i (1-q^i_e) (1+\theta \ln \frac{\bar{H}^i}{\bar{H}}) }{(1+r)^t} =\frac{C\bar{H}^i (1-q^i_e) (1+\theta \ln \frac{\bar{H}^i}{\bar{H}}) (1+r)}{r}
\ee

Clearly the value of firm under stagnant equilibrium is higher under larger exogenous Hicks-neutral production technology $C$, political-capital accumulation technology $B$, initial human capital endowment $\bar{H}^i$ and lower interest rate $r$.  The most remarkable result in this equilibrium, however, is that $\frac{d V_\theta }{d \theta} >0 $, which means a higher social unequal level could lead to a higher firm/stock value when firms only use raw labor but no human capital to conduct production.  

For the non-median corporation with relative social status $S^i$, the policy function for determining $q_e^i$ is as follows.
\be
\theta Q_e^* (\lambda \bar{H}^i + Q_e^i) =A (1+\theta \ln S_e^i)
\ee
where
\be
q_e^i=\frac{Q_e^i}{B \lambda \bar{H}+B Q_e^i}
\ee.

With the tool of comparative static analysis, it could be demonstrated that $\frac{d q_e^i}{d S_e^i}<0$ and $\frac{d Q_e^i}{d q_e^i}>0$ (proof in Appendix A4), which is consistent with the definition of $S^i_t$ that higher-rank agent has more political capital  and devotes more time in accumulating political resources.

The share value of the firm with relative class level $S^i$ is 
\be
V_\theta^{S^i}=\sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{C \bar{H}^i (1-q_e^i)(1+\theta \ln S^i)}{(1+r)^t}=\frac{C \bar{H}^i (1-q_e^i)(1+\theta \ln S^i) (1+r)}{r}
\ee

In the Appendix A5 we could demonstrate $\frac{V_\theta^{S^i}}{d S^i} > 0$ if and only if $B>1$. North Korea, to some extent, could be a suitable example depicting this equilibrium. The marginal gain from accumulating political capital exceeds marginal loss from relinquished production time for the sake of political capital accumulation. In this case, upper class has a far better agent value than lower class. For a rational agent, the reasonable choice is to make social status as high as possible. In North Korea's example, closely following the dictator seems to be the only rational choice for all agents, by fair means or foul.

Mathematically, it is also valid where $\frac{V_\theta^{S^i}}{d S^i} < 0$ when $B<1$. However, since we can hardly find any corresponding example in modern society, we will not consider this possibility.

Equilibrium I is stable.

(ii) Equilibrium II and III. (Increase in human capital accumulation)\\
As Equilibrium I could fail to depict the real world for most countries in 21st century, we switch to the Equilibrium II where exists steady growth in human capital accumulation. 
The condition $A h>1$ is sufficient to guarantee the existence of Equilibrium II. With Equation (19) and (20), it could be reached out that
\be
\lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{\bar{H}^i + H_t^i}{\bar{H}^i +H_{t+1}^i}=\frac{1}{A h_e^i} 
\ee
We rewrite equation (19),
\be
(\frac{A-r-1}{A}-q_e^i) \theta Q_{t+1}^* B(\lambda \bar{H}^i+Q_t^* S_e^i)=1+\theta \ln S_e^i
\ee
From the above equation it could be found $Q_t^i$ is bounded and we should have at the equilibrium state 
\be
\lim_{t \to \infty} Q_i^t= \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_e^i}{1-B q_e^i}
\ee
when
\be
B < \frac{1}{q_e^i}
\ee
which means the political-capital accumulation speed is slow in this equilibrium.
If $Q_t^*$ is replaced with $q_t^*$, then 
\be
(\frac{A-r-1}{A}-q_e^i) \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_e^i}{1-B q_e^i} B (\lambda \bar{H}^i+ \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_e^i}{1-B q_e^i}) =\frac{ S_e^i}{\theta}+ S_e^i \ln S_e^i
\ee
with 
\be
0 \leq q_e^i \left\{
  \ba 
    < \frac{1}{B}, \ \ \  \text{if}\ \  \frac{1}{B} \leq \frac{A-r-1}{A} \\
    \leq \frac{A}{A-r-1}, \ \ \  \text{if}\ \  \frac{1}{B} > \frac{A-r-1}{A} \\
  \ea \right.
\ee
We have two cases with different democracy level $B$.

\textbf{Equilibrium II (Democratic Equilibrium)}: When $\frac{1}{B} \leq \frac{A-r-1}{A}$, i.e. $B \geq \frac{A}{A-r-1}$, for higher class agents with $S_{dem}^i \geq 1$, no matter what $\theta$ is, there exists one unique equilibrium state $\{q_{dem}^i, h_{dem}^i, e_{dem}^i\}$. For lower class agents with $S_{dem}^i <1$, if and only if $\theta \leq -\frac{1}{\ln S_{dem}^i}$, there exists one unique equilibrium state $\{q_{dem}^i, h_{dem}^i, e_{dem}^i\}$. For all $0 < S_{dem}^i <\infty$, we have 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item (w.r.t social status)  $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p S_{dem}^i} >0$, $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p S_{dem}^i} < 0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p S_{dem}^i} = 0$
\item (w.r.t. political influence coefficient) $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p \theta} < 0$, $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p \theta} > 0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p \theta} = 0$
\item (w.r.t. to democracy level) $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p B} <0$, $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p B} > 0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p B} = 0$
\item (w.r.t how raw human capital impacts initial political endowments) $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p \lambda} <0$, $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p \lambda} > 0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p \lambda} = 0$
\item (w.r.t. human capital accumulation coefficient) $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p A} < 0$, $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p A} > 0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p A} < 0$
\item (w.r.t. interest rate) $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p r} > 0$, $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p r} < 0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p r} > 0$
\end{enumerate} 
Proof is in Appendix B1.

In the democratic case (B high enough) a unique equilibrium could be reached with relative small proportion of allocation on political capital and large on human capital accumulation (comparing to \textbf{Equilibrium III Authoritarian Case} in the following context). In our benchmark model human capital is the only accelerator of long-term economic growth. Property (a) indicates that political advantaged agents invest less in human capital than in political capital because marginal profit from investing an additional unit of political capital is higher. It is demonstrated in property (b) that the country with large political influence ($\theta$) should enjoy a higher prosperity level. Most low-rank agents in the social rank pyramid respond to high political influence by reducing inefficient political capital investment, leading to an increase in human capital stock. The most remarkable property is that the growth level strictly increases with respect to democracy level. Different from Acemoglu and Robinson's dichotomous definition of institution (intrinsic and extractive), we adopt political capital accumulation speed ($B$) to capture the democracy level, which is allowed to be continuous in our approach. From property (c), it is explicitly stated without ambiguity that human capital accumulation is positively related to the inclusiveness of political institution. The economic intuition of property (d) could be better interpreted as labor union. Recalling the definition of political capital accumulation, $\lambda$ is a good indicator reflecting the strength of union. Property (d) demonstrates that countries with high union power is accompanied by high human capital investment level. Property (e) and (f) is the natural extension of previous deduction in the previous content of this article, where human capital investment increases with high human-capital-augmenting technology and low interest rate condition. 

In Figure 4 we simulate the Democratic Equilibrium with $B=2$, $\bar{H}^i=1$, $\lambda=1$, $A=5$, $r=0.1$.

When $B$ is not high enough, say $B<\frac{A}{A-r-1}$, the following authoritarian equilibrium is reached out.

\textbf{Equilibrium III (Authoritarian Equilibrium)} When $\frac{1}{B} > \frac{A-r-1}{A}$, i.e. $B < \frac{A}{A-r-1}$, there are two equilibrium states. \\
(i) \textbf{Equilibrium IIIG (Good Authoritarian Equilibrium)}  $\{q_{autg}^i, h_{autg}^i, e_{autg}^i\}$ when (a) $S_{aut}^i \geq 1$, $\theta \geq \theta(S_{aut})$ or (b) $S_{aut}^i<1$ , $\theta(S_{aut}) \leq \theta \leq - \frac{1}{\ln S_{aut}^i}$, where $\theta(S_{aut}^i)$ is a threshold depending on $S_{aut}^i$. The property of good authoritarian equilibrium is the same as Equilibrium II (Democratic Equilibrium) $\{q_{dem}^i, h_{dem}^i, e_{dem}^i\}$ \\
(ii) \textbf{Equilibrium IIIB (Bad Authoritarian Equilibrium)}  $\{q_{autb}^i, h_{autb}^i, e_{autb}^i\}$ when (a) $S_{aut}^i \geq 1$, $\theta \geq \theta(S_{aut})$ or (b) $S_{aut}^i<1$ , $\theta(S_{aut}) \leq \theta \leq -\frac{1}{\ln S_{aut}^i}$, where the threshold function $\theta(S_{aut}^i)$ is the same as good equilibrium case. When we compare good equilibrium $\{q_{autg}^i, h_{autg}^i, e_{autg}^i\}$ with bad equilibirium $\{q_{autb}^i, h_{autb}^i, e_{autb}^i\}$, we have 
\be
q_{autg}^i \geq q^* \geq q_{autb}^i,\ \  h_{autg}^i \leq  \frac{A-r-1}{A}- q^* \leq h_{autb}^i ,\ \  e_{autg}^i = e_{autb}^i = \frac{1+r}{A}
\ee 
where
\be
0 <q^*=\frac{A-r-1}{2A+B+Br-AB} < \frac{A-r-1}{A} <\frac{1}{B}
\ee
and following 6 properties.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item (w.r.t social status)  $\frac{\p q_{autb}^i}{\p S_{aut}^i} < 0$, $\frac{\p h_{autb}^i}{\p S_{aut}^i} > 0$, $\frac{\p e_{autb}^i}{\p S_{aut}^i} = 0$

Proof is in Appendix B2.

In the authoritarian case, there exist two equilibrium. One is called ``good" authoritarian equilibrium while the other is ``bad". The characteristics of good authoritarian equilibrium is the similar to democratic one. More prestigious firms invest more in human capital but not political resources. A larger political influence coefficient leads to an increasing human capital accumulation effort while the enhancement of democratic level improves human capital condition. Typical countries staying in this authoritarian ``good" equilibrium include Singapore, Qatar and United Arab Emirates. On the other hand, ``bad" authoritarian equilibrium has very different characteristics. Examples could be Cambodia, Russia and Indonesia. The equilibrium investing in political capital increases with decreasing social ranks, where firms lack of political capital have to put much effort in political capital accumulation to avoid being exploited thoroughly. All agents respond to an increasing level of political influence coefficient $\theta$ by throwing more time spent on political investments, which is exactly contrary to the democratic and authoritarian ``good" equilibrium. Property (c) demonstrates that the increasing democracy level $B$ in ``bad" authoritarian equilibrium could make the whole economy worse with less human capital accumulation. The democracy reform of Soviet Union under president Mikhail Gorbachev could be a good example reflecting this property. Unless the improvement could switch bad authoritarian equilibrium to good or democratic one, the incomplete democracy reform itself could stimulate agents in the economy to quit investment in human capital and turn back to invest in political capital. 


In Figure 5 we simulate the Authoritarian Equilibrium with $B=1$, $\bar{H}^i=1$, $\lambda=1$, $A=5$, $r=0.1$.

Then the question comes what is the condition for a country to stay in good authoritarian equilibrium or bad one. First, it depends on the peer choice. If most companies within the same class remain in a bad one, the rest within their cohort could not have much choices other than following the majority. Second, the choices among various classes are intertwined with each other, making the choice within one class highly depend on others. In most cases, if the dictator chooses low-human-capital and high-political-capital states, the rest entities in the economy have to devote a dominating proportion of time to allocating political capital to escape exploitation losses. Third, the level of political capital threshold could have deterministic impact on the choice between good and bad authoritarian equilibrium. In the country like United Arab Emirates, millions of immigrants who could never achieve permanent residency work diligently in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, lowering local political beneficial threshold $Q^*$. The differences of immigration policy partly explain why United Arab Emirates stays in the good authoritarian equilibrium while Vietnam with fewer immigrants is in the bad one.

\begin{subsection}{Case Study}

\textbf{Equilibrium I}

In Equilibrium I, there is no human capital accumulation because $A \leq 2 + r$. This describes the situation in many least developed countries, where political instability, prevalence of human rights invasion and ongoing warfare drive up the discount rate to a level so high that any substantial human capital accumulation becomes not worthwhile. This equilibrium most likely depicts the case in those least developed countries such as North Korea, Syria and many Sub-Saharan countries. In Middle East Asian and Sub-Saharan countries that are without centralized political authorities, citizens cannot be certain about what the social order will be like in the near future and therefore, cannot commit themselves to making long-term investment in any education or training. In North Korea, although there exists a centralized government, the inflation rate has remained at high level varying between 30\% to triple digits. At the same time, North Korean citizens lack most of basic human rights such as basic education, which yields a relatively small $A$ (human capital accumulation technology coefficient). In our model, these two factors combined trap the country in economic stagnancy despite a centralized political authority.

\textbf{Equilibrium II}

When $A \leq 2 + r$ and $B \geq \frac{A}{A-r-1}$, countries fall into the status of Equilibrium II, which largely reflects the reality in democratic nations since $B$ is the political access coefficient. Democratic countries here refer to countries that are politically inclusive and where the access to political power is generally open and fair to everyone. United States is definitely a good example since everyone can acquire political capital through various channels, such as military service, advocacy work and community service. The election process involves almost all citizens and have a high level of procedural transparency. Others countries that qualify for this category include United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and developing democratic countries including Brazil and India. 

Within the same country, companies enjoying more abundant stock of political capital will choose to invest more in political capital while companies that rank lower in relative political capital stock will invest more in human capital according to Equilibrium II property (a). This deduced property is in conformity with our observations that at an initial stage, small companies focus on its core competency and technology and when they grow bigger, they start to participate more actively in industrial standard establishment and seek more connections with policy makers and regulators. Although they can still invest a great deal in human resource, on a relative scale they mostly allocate more resource in public relations and politics compared to at initial stage of their businesses. 

If we examine across countries with distinct political environment, investment in political capital decrease or human capital investment increases with respect to $B$ or $\theta$ increase. United States, in our modeling, enjoys a high level of both $B$ and $\theta$, and it has been investing a huge amount in human capital. While $B$ describes how easy political capital is accessible to everyone, theta means how influential companies can exert this political power. The property indicates that when it is easier to gain and execute political capital ($B$ and $\theta$ is larger) countries invest more human capital. This might be somehow counter-intuitive but it is in fact reasonable if we think about it. United States actually has a higher $B$ and theta compared to Brazil and India. Why? Because in the United States, electoral process and policy making are much more transparent and routine. For example, in 1995, Congress passed the \textit{Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)} that defined the term ``lobbyist" as \textit{``any individual who is employed or retained by a client for financial or other compensation for services that include more than one lobbying contact…."}, and all legal documents of this sort make political activity a smoother and more standardized process manageable and accessible to all market participants. In this case, companies do not have to engage in illegal activities or wander around grey legal and policy arena to accumulate and execute political power and therefore, choose to invest more ``effort" in human capital. California has been the heart of Democratic states due to Democrat's favourable policies on immigrants and regulation freedom. Since 2008, the Internet firms, software companies, computer manufacturers and data processors that comprise Silicon Valley have delivered more than 172 million dollars in campaign contributions for federal elections, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. This amount is not as much if we look at another case in India. In 2013, Indian government launched an investigation on the allegations that Wal-Mart had bribed officials in New Delhi to gain access to India's lucrative retail market, amount of which is disclosed at around 25 million dollars. Assertions that lobbying is tantamount to bribery are common in India, reflecting that the country's legal and policy ambivalence towards the practice is not formally regulated. As a result, endemic corruption slows down the development in India and impedes investment in technology and human capital. Brazil shares a similar story and is thus deeply sunk in distress due to corruption and bribery scandals.  

\textbf{Equilibrium IIIG}

In both Equilibrium IIIG and IIIB, countries who have the property of $B < \frac{A}{A-r-1}$ are classified into ``authoritarian" regimes. In the case of Equilibrium IIIG, authoritarian countries enjoy similar resource allocation strategy in human and political capital to countries in Equilibrium II. However, if authoritarian countries unfortunately fall into Equilibrium IIIB, the properties can change massively and generally witness much more investment in political capital rather than human capital. In reality, we can find only a few countries satisfying these characteristics, including Singapore and Qatar. Constitutionally, Singapore is a parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government. However, as People's Action Party has been in control since Singapore's independence, this country is mostly regarded as an authoritarian if not autarky. Qatar is known as an absolute monarchy. However, both Singapore and Qatar are among the richest countries: Singapore has GDP per capita of more than 50,000 US dollars and Qatar more than 70,000 US dollars. 

There are two factors playing a major part in drawing countries to either equilibrium. The first factor is $Q^*$, the politically influential threshold. Note that both Singapore and Qatar have large population of foreign workers. Singapore has 1.4 million foreign workers equivalent to 25\% of total population. Qatar is notorious of its exploitation of migrant workers which construct more than 90\% of its population. High percentage of migrant workers lowers countries' $Q^*$ level, which means that for most companies established by citizens with political rights, they receive extra benefits aside from their own production. Migrant workers provide products and services generating bonus revenues to citizens through government income-transfer such as taxes. The second factor that drives authoritarian countries into this equilibrium rather than Equilibrium IIIB is the result of choices made by the majority of companies at similar $Q$ levels, which was ultimately decided by the highest political class of the societies. For example, under the system of meritocracy forged by renowned First Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore government was highly effective and introduced legislation giving the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) great power to conduct arrests, search, call up witnesses, and investigate bank accounts and income-tax returns of the suspected officials. The choice of curbing investment in political power made by the leader is equivalent to a strong pull to the good equilibrium for the authoritarian country. Similar in Qatar, the government has streamlined its regulations regarding business practices and engaged in reforms from above that have liberalized the Qatar's economy and increased its strength and viability, which makes it among the highest performing countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The initial ``choice" from the highest-ranked political leaders also play a major part in securing the countries on the ``good”" equilibrium together with the factor of $Q^*$. 

\textbf{Equilibrium IIIB}

Equilibrium IIIB reflects authoritarian countries who unfortunately stay with the ``bad" equilibrium. Typical countries include many of those in South Asia such as Cambodia and Bangladesh, in Middle Asia such as Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and in Africa such as Uganda and Kenya. In this status, citizens put more efforts in acquiring political power than human capital, although their human capital still grows very slowly compared to countries in Equilibrium I stagnant economy where human capital deteriorates over time. The properties of this equilibrium are exactly opposite to Equilibrium IIIG. Within the same country, companies enjoying more abundant stock of political capital will choose to invest less in political capital. If we examine across countries with distinct political environment, investment in political capital increase or human capital investment decreases with respect to $B$ or $\theta$ increase. The property indicates that when it is easier to gain and execute political capital ($B$ and $\theta$ is larger), countries invest less human capital. 

These contrary properties relative to democratic equilibrium provide a possible explanation on why issues can emerge if authoritarian countries, without changing their political regimes, directly copy some specific policies from United States. For example, Unites States' legalizing lobbying activities, which is clearly the action to increase $B$ and $\theta$ in our model, might never take place in authoritarian countries, because political leaders are aware of the disastrous consequences that could result from this policy shift: all will choose to invest as much as possible in political capital and the economy will suffer. Instead, political leaders in authoritarian countries usually advocate anti-corruption moves and exert all efforts to crack down nepotism and bribery although these actions are futile for most of time. In these authoritarian countries, if autocrats imprudently decide to adopt more politically inclusive policies such as legalizing lobby activities and granting more policy-making influence to companies, their own political power might be eroded and the country will be kicked off on the path towards a politically inclusive country if $B$ becomes larger than $\frac{A}{A-r-1}$ which is condition for countries to stay in Equilibrium II. Acemoglu in his book (2012) has also reached similar conclusions that autocrats choose to stay autocrats because making the regime politically or economically inclusive will result in the deprivation of their own power. 

\textbf{Transitional Status}

Like any theoretical models, the listed equilibrium cannot fully describe all countries in the world. Many countries, however, are in the transitional status somewhere in between these equilibrium discussed. For example, China, being identified as an ``authoritarian" regime, has witnessed fast economic growth during past decades of reform and opening up economic policy. However, its political inclusiveness has not been improved at the same scale of economic policy reform. There are three directions China might fall onto: Equilibrium II, Equilibrium IIIG and Equilibrium IIIB. 

To reach Equilibrium II, China needs to switch to a regime more politically inclusive just like the democracy reform Taiwan experienced during 1980s after Kaohsiung Incident. This requires politically-influential upper class to relinquish a substantial political power and liberate political capital market, and therefore, considerably increase B to a level higher than $\frac{A}{A-r-1}$. This without doubt a deprivation of political upper class's vested interest. The process can be extremely bumpy and might cause painful turbulence to China's economy. The number of countries who enjoy a sustainable growth by human capital accumulation in Equilibrium IIIG are relatively limited compared to Equilibrium I. We have only found Singapore, Qatar and maybe the United Arab Emirates who are successful in economic growth. Common characteristics among them include: 1. The size of their economies is small, which simplifies the process of streamlining regulations regarding business practices and any liberalization schemes; 2. Their economies depend heavily on migrant workers. China is an economy with much more complicated properties including regional development difference, rural-urban divide, aging societies and homogeneity of labor force (few immigrants). Therefore if China is to progress towards Equilibrium IIIG, there might not be proper role-models to follow. If China fails to transition into Equilibrium II or IIIG, the only option left in our model is IIIB, the equilibrium for most of the underdeveloped nations now where economic development is largely restrained under a stable authoritarian regime. 


\end{subsection}

\begin{subsection}{Concluding Remarks}
This paper has explored different ways nations can develop. By finding stable statuses under assumptions of parameters, we have identified theoretical development patterns for stagnant countries, politically inclusive countries and authoritarian countries. For politically inclusive countries, there exists only one equilibrium and the share of resource allocation to human capital depends on how effective political capital can influence production redistribution and the politically beneficial threshold. For authoritarian countries, unlike mainstream argument that their economic growth is most likely unsustainable, our modeling result suggests that it is possible for those countries to enjoy long-lasting economic development as well if they happens to stay with the ``good" equilibrium given proper political and policy nudges. We believe these results to be important for understanding why nations succeed and provide a theoretical framework where practical policy-making can be built on.

This article also sheds light on future research in political and development economics. The precise calibration and estimation of political accessibility index $B$ and political influence parameter $\theta$ is beyond further research, which is somehow different from current widely-used democracy or corruption index. At least from Equilibrium IIIG we know there are more than one way towards long-term economic prosperity. But what is the initial motive for authoritarian countries like Singapore, Qatar leaning to high human capital and low political capital investment? For example, what drives Singapore to enact immigrant-friendly policy thus lowering the local political beneficial threshold $Q^*$ so that it could have more chance getting close to good authoritarian equilibrium? Could the size of economy play a part? Or it is simply because Singapore is lucky enough to have Cambridge First Class Honor graduate Lee Kuan Yew as  its founding father while unfortunate for Philippines to have rapacious Ferdinand Marcos. This, of course, calls for future works.

B1. Proof of \textbf{Equilibrium II}\\
First we prove a Lemma.\\
\textbf{Lemma.} Under $B \geq \frac{A}{A-r-1}$ and $0 \leq q_{dem}^i <\frac{1}{B}$, we have $AB-A-B-Br \geq 0$ and $A-r-1-Aq_{dem}^i >0$.\\
\be
\ba
&AB-A-B-Br \geq 0\\ 
\Leftrightarrow\  &AB-Br-B \geq A\\
\Leftrightarrow\  & B \geq \frac{A}{A-r-1}
\ea
\ee 
and
\be
\ba
&A-r-1-Aq_{dem}^i >0\\
\Leftrightarrow \  & q_{dem}^i < \frac{A-r-1}{A} \\
& \text{This is because } q_{dem}^i<\frac{1}{B} \leq  \frac{A-r-1}{A}\\
\ea
\ee
\textbf{Lemma} is proved.\\
With
\be
(\frac{A-r-1}{A}-q_{dem}^i) \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_{dem}^i}{1-B q_{dem}^i} B (\lambda \bar{H}^i+ \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_{dem}^i}{1-B q_{dem}^i}) =\frac{ S_{dem}^i}{\theta}+ S_{dem}^i \ln S_{dem}^i
\ee
we define 
\be
LHS(q_{dem}^i)=(\frac{A-r-1}{A}-q_{dem}^i) \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_{dem}^i}{1-B q_{dem}^i} B (\lambda \bar{H}^i+ \frac{B \lambda \bar{H}^i q_{dem}^i}{1-B q_{dem}^i}) 
\ee
Notice $LHS(0)=0$ and $\lim_{q_{dem}^i \to \frac{1}{B}} LHS(q_{dem}^i)= \infty$, then we show $\frac{d LHS(q_{dem}^i)}{d q_{dem}^i}>0$
\be
\ba
\frac{d LHS(q_{dem}^i)}{d q_{dem}^i}&= -\frac{B^2 \bar{H}^{i2} (A (1+(-2+B) q_{dem}^i)-(1+B q_{dem}^i) (1+r)) \lambda ^2}{A (-1+B q_{dem}^i)^3} \\
& = -\frac{B^2 \bar{H}^{i2}\lambda ^2 (q_{dem}^i (A B-A-B-B r)+(A-r-1-A q_{dem}^i) ) }{A (-1+B q_{dem}^i)^3}\\
& >0
\ea
\ee
The last inequality is due to \textbf{Lemma} and $B q_{dem}^i <1$\\
we define 
\be
RHS(\theta, S_{dem}^i)=\frac{ S_{dem}^i}{\theta}+ S_{dem}^i \ln S_{dem}^i
\ee
If $S_{dem}^i \geq 1$, with any $\theta \geq 0$, we have $RHS(\theta, S_{dem}^i) \geq 0$. Thanks to \textit{Intermediate Value Theorem}, we could show there exists a unique $q_{dem}^i \in [0, \frac{1}{B})$ to make the $LHS=RHS$. If $S_{dem}^i <1$, when $\theta < - \frac{1}{\ln S_{dem}^i}$, $RHS <0$, the equilibrium does not exist; when $\theta \geq - \frac{1}{\ln S_{dem}^i}$, $RHS \geq 0$, it exists a unique equilibrium $q_{dem}^i \in [0, \frac{1}{B})$

Since $\frac{d LHS(q_{dem}^i)}{d q_{dem}^i}>0$ for $q_{dem}^i \in [0, \frac{1}{B})$, we have
\be
\frac{d q_{dem}^i}{d RHS}>0
\ee
and with $\frac{d RHS}{d S_{dem}^i }>0$ and $\frac{d RHS}{d \theta} < 0$
we have $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p S_{dem}^i} >0$ and $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p \theta} <0$. Under $q_{dem}^i+h_{dem}^i =\frac{A-r-1}{A}$, we could reach out
$\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p S_{dem}^i} <0$, $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p \theta} <0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p S_{dem}^i} =0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p \theta} =0$, 

By calculating the total differetiation of $LHS$ and rearraning terms, we have 
\be
\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p B} = \frac{2 q_{dem}^i (1+A (-1+q_{dem}^i)+r)}{B [ q_{dem}^i (A B-A-B-B r)+(A-r-1-A q_{dem}^i)]} < 0
\ee
The inequality is because of \textbf{Lemma}. So $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p B} > 0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p B} = 0$.\\
Similarly we have
\be
\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p \lambda} =  -\frac{2 q_{dem}^i (-1+B q_{dem}^i) (1+A (-1+q_{dem}^i)+r)}{\lambda [ q_{dem}^i (A B-A-B-B r)+(A-r-1-A q_{dem}^i)]} <0
\ee
So $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p \lambda} >0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p \lambda} =0$.\\
And
\be
\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p A}=\frac{q_{dem}^i (-1+B q_{dem}^i) (1+r)}{A [ q_{dem}^i (A B-A-B-B r)+(A-r-1-A q_{dem}^i)]} < 0
\ee
and $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p A} = -\frac{r+1}{A^2} <0$. With constraint $h_{dem}^i+q_{dem}^i+e_{dem}^i =1$, we have $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p A} >0 $. \\
Similarly we could demonstrate $\frac{\p q_{dem}^i}{\p r} > 0$, $\frac{\p h_{dem}^i}{\p r} < 0$, $\frac{\p e_{dem}^i}{\p r} > 0$ \qed

\be
\ba
&0<q^*=\frac{A-r-1}{2 A +B +Br-AB}<\frac{A-r-1}{A}\\
&\Leftrightarrow 2 A +B +Br-AB >A\\
&\Leftrightarrow AB-Br-B <A\\
&\Leftrightarrow B <\frac{A}{A-r-1}

\textbf{Lemma*} is proved.\\
we define

\begin{section} {Chapter 4: Income Inequality and Consumption Inequality in China}

\begin{subsection} {Introduction}
Thanks to the Reform and Opening-up Policy since 1978, the past three decades have witnessed dramatic economic growth in China with more than 10\% annualized growth rate (World Bank 2013). Accompanies with the economics prosperity magic, we could never fail to notice the alarming spike of inequality of China in the past 30 years. Measured by income Gini coefficient, the income inequality rose from 0.24 in 1991 to 0.33 in 2003 and 0.42 in 2010 (Cai, Chen and Zhou 2010; Ravallion & Chen 2004; Meng et al 2010; Li and Luo 2010). Hukou restriction and urbanization could serve as major explanatory power to the booming income inequality. All the income group experienced significant income raise while the top one enjoyed the fastest growth rate. Meanwhile, consumption inequality rose with similar magnitude. Consumption per capita Gini coefficient increased from 0.25 in 1992 to 0.33 in 2013.
The proportional income and consumption inequality growth points to the central question of this paper. According to basic economical principals and evidence in other economies, consumption inequality should be less than income     because of diminishing marginal consumption interest
(Katz 1992; Johnson and Smeeding 1998). Rich cohort tends to save more to partially insure against some permanent income shocks (Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston 2008). Precautionary saving motives and liquidity constraints help explain the excess marginal saving rate among the top-income cohort against uninsured idiosyncratic risk (Aiyaragi 1994). Empirical evidences also support the theoretical proposition for the United States (Beach 1977; Deaton 1992; Atkinson 1993; Wolfson 1994; Blundell 2008), Canada (Buse 1982; Pendakur 1998), United Kindom (Atkinson 1993), Netherlands and many other economic entities (Gouveia and Tavares 1995). But we could hardly find similar evidence for China. The reported consumption inequality is more than or approximately equivalent to the reported income inequality (Cai et al. 2010).
This article attempts to provide a feasible approach to solve the puzzle. Are the consumption habits among different income group in China different from those abovementioned developed economies? Or is it because the survey statistical data inaccurate to capture the true income and
consumption inequality? Our answer is the latter one. The income inequality in under-measured in the survey. Using our proposed methodology to compute the real income and consumption inequality, the income inequality outnumbers the consumption one in all available survey periods in China, which is consistent with the economic intuition and empirical results among other regions of the world.
To unveil the true income of all groups, we need to revisit and revise the inaccurate reported income and consumption data. For instance, high income cohort in China may underreport their aggregated income for tax evasion purpose. Individual in US has to report all income (labor income, capital gains, self-employed returns, inherited legacies, etc.) to IRS to tax return purpose annually while there is no need for individual in China to do so. Consequently, alternative income besides labor gains might not be reported to statistics bureau and survey investigators. At the same time, some illegal income sources would never be reported accurately, particularly for those rent-seekers. Communist Party members and government officials, to some extent, obtain increasing opportunities to get (unlawful) benefits from the rent-seeking economic activities like license-issuing and land-regulation. From the media report and Central Discipline Inspection Commission’s announcement, there are more than 120 high-level government officials founded to commit severe corruption crimes recently. The systematic underreporting income (Zhang, Giles, and Rozelle 2012; Gong, Liu and McLaughlin 2017) of Communist Party members leads to an unconvincing reported income data points and therefore distorts inequality measurement. So-called “gray-income” of high-income groups would be underestimated if we ignore the (unlawful) benefits of government affiliated or government related employees (Wang and Woo (2011)). The reported consumption inequality on average is 0.9\% to 12.6\% higher than income inequality between 1995 and 2002 while our imputed revealed (true) income inequality on average is 0.3\% to 26\% higher than consumption inequality for the same period, which solves the empirical puzzle between China and the rest of world raised by the existing literature.
The following part of the articles is presented as follows. Section 2 presents a true-income- revealing computational methodology by implementing Engel's law between necessity goods and aggregated consumption. Section 3 describes the data set and empirical findings of possible income underreporting problem for some cohorts, income and consumption inequality, provides comparison to existing inequality literature calculations and highlights our contributions. Section 4 provides concluding remarks and guidance to future research.

\end{subsection}

\subsection{True Income Revealing Methodology: The Engel's law between necessity goods consumption and income}


Engel’s Law captures the empirical relationship between necessity goods consumption and aggregate consumption. It is well documented that as income rises, the proportion of income spent on
even if absolute amount rises. We want to use the well-establish necessity goods consumption proportion and income relationship to recover the true income of all individuals. We have the following Equation(1).
\begin{equation*}
    w_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(I_{ij}) + \PSi X_{ij} + \gamma_j +u_i
\end{equation*}

where $w_{ij}$ denoted necessity goods consumption proportion for family i in city j and $I_{ij}$  represents income for this household. $u_i$ are the idiosyncratic error terms.

$X_{ij}$ here denotes certain family characteristics influencing necessity goods consumption share, which includes family size, in-house sex ratio, number of children aged 15 or less, average age and age squared
of family members, age and age squared of household head, education level of household heads, gender of household heads, number of refrigerators, house size, independency of kitchen and locations of house. $\gamma_j$ captures city fixed effect that controls local price levels.

The definition of consumption and income could vary under different criteria. We would try three approaches by varying the categories of the necessity goods.

(a) Food consumption approach

(a1) $I_{ij}$ includes all wage income, net business income, net property income and net transfer income.Food consumption includes cigarette consumption.

(a2) $I_{ij}$ contains all wage income, net business income, net property income, transfer income, in-kind income and rent benefits from house rental (market rent minus rent paid). Cigarette consumption is not included in the food consumption.

For house renters, we impute the rental house benefits as the market rent of the occupied housing . For house owners, the rental house benefits are
calculated as market rent minus rent paid. Both results are reported for the main results and robustness check parts.
The empirical exercises are based on two important assumptions. (i) We assume that the food consumption share is accurate for all people. Underreporting income does not necessitate underreporting food consumption share in the survey. The latter one has no tax gains or utility obtaining. (ii) Income is accurately reported for the selected base group. As a result, equation (1) depicts the precise relationship between food share and income. It should be expected that coefficient $\beta_1$ is significantly negative to reflect the spirit of Engel’s Law.

Base group should be selected very carefully to fulfill the requirement of (b2) to avoid the potential bias. In other words, individuals in the base group should not either underreport or over-report their aggregated income. We adopt the following several approaches.
(X1) Base group is the bottom X per cent income group.
(X2) Base group is the bottom X per cent income group with the all family members not belonging to Communist Party.
We will let X vary from bottom 10\%, 11\%, ..., 40\% to report 31 different estimate results in Table 3 for the year 1995, 1999, 2002 respectively to guarantee robustness. The reason for choosing (X1) as base group is that low income cohort has less tendency to report the income inaccurately. They don’t need to underreport the income for the tax evasion purpose. On the contrary, they have very limited incentive to over-report income for the government subsidy as Chinese governmental subsidy and transfer payment to the poor is of vast scarcity during 1995 and 2002. We could notice (X2) is a subset of (X1). (X2) is expected to serve a better base group since non-communist party members have the least opportunities touching the “grey income” territory and therefore the income reports tend to become more convincing. The only differences between base group (X1) and (X2) is the low income communist party member. There is empirical evidence (Gong, Liu and McLaughlin 2017) documenting potential “grey- income” opportunities for those low income party members. For instance, party members may have the chances to receive gift cards and food subsidy during holiday seasons. It is reported many low-level communist party employees and party members of state-own enterprises misuse the reimbursement policy to pay personal items and travel expenditures with public resources. Thus, (X2) serves another alternative approach to unveil the true income for the whole universe.

Also, the following two base group selection approaches are also implemented for robustness check to increase the exercise validity.

(X3) Base group is the bottom X per cent income group with the all family members neither belonging to Communist Party nor working in the governmental institutions or state-owned enterprises.

(X4) Base group is the bottom X per cent income group with the all family members not belonging to Communist Party. And all the base group members should work in the companies. (Here companies represent all types of corporations including state-owned, private-owned and individual owned enterprises. Government related institutions are excluded)

Notice the base group in (X3) and (X4) are subsets of the one in (X2). Despite the strength of more precise selection of the base group, (X3) and (X4) could lead to the potential weakness of more scarce data points in the base group. Comparing to (X2), (X3) excludes the low income party members in the non-communist party dominated corporations, with little evidence in the existing literature documenting potential “grey income” opportunities to unlawfully taking advantage of party memberships. Non- communist party dominated corporations are widely believed to be profit maximizing economy entities, with sufficient incentive and well-recognized ability to prevent hazardous rent-seeking behaviors of the employees no matter the party memberships. (X4) relaxes a little bit by including all companies’ workers both state-owned and private-owned. With recent literature evidence, the similarity between state-owned enterprises (SOE) and private-owned ones outnumbers the one between SOE and governmental institutions (Song 2015), overturning the previously widely believed concept on the opposite direction. Therefore, we have reasonable evidence to put together both SOE and private-owned ones to further check the robustness of our examination.

From Chart 1, the food share among aggregated consumption drops from 50.1\% in 1995 to 42.1\% in 1999 and then 37.7
\% in 2002 with National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) official data, indicating the downward trending in the food consumption with economics development, with absolute consistency of the definition of necessity goods. Under our proposed (a1) definition of food consumption, the food shares in consumption plummet from 47\% in 1995 to 43\% in 2002. While under (a2) definition food shares decrease from 49\% in 1995 to 40\% in 2002, reflecting an even sharper reduction in the cigarette consumption given cigarette is taken into (a2) definition. All the evidences give us hint that food consumption is appropriately chosen as the representative of necessity goods, with both theoretical foundation and empirical supports.

(b) Clothes consumption approach

Clothes is also treated as base consumption with income elasticity between zero and one. The cloth consumption will not likely be cut back on even when times are tough, sharing the similarity with food consumption. We also use two approaches to recalibrate the true income of the overall cohort. In (b1) the income includes all wage income, net business income, net property income and net transfer income and in (b2) in-kind income and rent benefits from house rental are also taken into account the income.
(X1) to (X4) approaches are implemented in the similar way of part (a) food Engel's Law estimated equation. The only difference is that in the control variables X01 we ignore number of children aged 15 or less, number of refrigerators, house size, independency of kitchen and locations of house but keep all the rest. Naturally those deleted control variables have little relationship with the household aggregated clothes consumption but only food consumption. In order to make the estimate results more precisely we make such deletion. All clothes consumption containing school uniform spending are incorporated. Unfortunately, we don’t have the official summary statistics of clothes consumption shares from BLS China. But still, in Chart 1, our calculation shows a 2\% drop of clothes shares from 12\% in 1995 to 10\% in 1999 and 2002 respectively no matter what kind of income definition we use. As a result, clothes consumption serve properly as a representing item of necessity good to reveal the true income for the whole cohort.

(c) Utilities consumptions approach

Utilities spending is generally treated as another crucial part of necessity goods spending. The adoption of utilities spending in our analysis is natural and displays supportive evidence to unveil the relationship between income inequality and consumption inequality. The definition of utility here includes water, electricity, fire coals spending. Natural gas is not listed separately in the survey data and not widely introduced and assembled in the vast majority families of China during the 1990s. We only report the 1995 and 1999 results as there are only less than 200 valid observations filling in utility consumption in 2002. (X1) to (X4) approached are repeated with similar methodologies documented in part (a). Similarly, in (c1) the income includes all wage income, net business income, net property income and net transfer income while in-kind income and rent benefits from house rental are included in (c2) approach. For the control variables X01 we also delete number of children aged 15 or less, number of refrigerators, house size, independency of kitchen and locations, which seem to uncorrelated with the household utility consumption behavior.


From Chart 1 we could find the utility shares increase from 4\% in 1995 to 7
\% in 2002, somehow dis-according with the observed phenomenon of decreasing clothes and utility shares
plummet. Nevertheless, we still list the utility approach to enhance the validity of our examination as utility, regardless of standards, is regarded as the indispensable part of necessity goods consumption.

We have to ask if there exist any other particular consumption variables that are also appropriate to estimate the Engel's law relationship. For example, Ding, He and Zhu (2017) use more general durable and non-durable goods to reveal the true income level following the econometric methodology of Aguiar and Bils (2015). With our empirical approaches there must not exist structural break of consumption habits between base group and non-base group. For instance, the non-durable goods consumption habits might vary very differently for the base group (poorer cohort) and the non-base group (the rest). As a result, we might feel uncomfortable using non-durable goods consumption behaviors to reveal the true income inequality in this paper. Also, Engel's Law literally captures only the linear relationship between necessity good consumption share and aggregated income, which is inappropriate to describe other non- linear relationship. Consequently, we are not using variables like education expenditure share that might have complex relationship with earnings as Mincer’s Equation reminds us possible linear and quadratic relationships between education and earnings. Food, clothes and utility are thus by far all the possible variables in CHIP database we could use to estimate the Engel's Law linear relationship.

In the last part of this section we briefly introduce how to recover each person’s aggregate income through Engel's Law estimations. It is straightforward to reverse Equation (1) to impute the realized income but it could suffer from the omitted variable bias problem. As a result, we would like to adopt the alternative imputation method introduced by Pissaride, Weber 1989 and Deng, Wei, Wu 2016.

Household true income is decomposed into two separate components: reported and unreported parts. By assuming unreported parts are proportional to the reported income. We have the following relationship between those two parts of income. We have the following expression (2).

\begin{equation*}
    I_i = RI_i + UI_i = RI_i + \mu RI_i = RI_i (1 + \mu)
\end{equation*}

where I is true income, RI is reported income and UI is underreported income. Replacing the decomposed income expression (2) in the basic Engel's Law Equation (1), the following expression (3) is obtained for all individuals.

\begin{equation*}
    w_{ij} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \log (RI_{ij}) + \gamma_2 \log (1+\mu) + \Psi X_{ij} + \gamma_j + u_i
\end{equation*}

If we assume only people not in the base group might inaccurately report overall earnings, the proportion of reported income can be estimated with a dummy variable indicating whether in the base group. We have the following equation (4).

\begin{equation*}
    w_{ij} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \log (RI_{ij}) + \gamma'_2 dummy_i + \Psi X_{ij} + \gamma_j + u_i
\end{equation*}

where dummy equals 0 referring base group and 1 indicating comparison group member i, respectively.

Comparing Equation (3) and (4) we have the identical relation $\gamma'_2 dummy_i = \gamma_2 $ so that we could estimate $\mu$, the proportion of underreported income to reported income as $\mu = exp(\frac{\gamma'_2}{\gamma_2}) - 1$.  The final income inequality and consumption inequality results are reported under equation (3) and (4). We do notice there are other income inequality measurements like 20:20 ratio, Palma ratio, Hoover index, coefficients of variation, Theil index, Atkinson Index, etc. To fairly compare with the results from the vast majority literatures of income and consumption, only income and consumption Gini index are calculated, reported and compared.

\subsection{Data and results}

The data we use in the analysis is from Chinese Household Income Project Series (CHIP). The data is originally designed to measure and estimate the distribution of personal income in both rural and urban areas of the People's Republic of China. Data is collected in 1988, 1995, 1999, 2002, 2007 and 2013. These surveys were carried out as part of a collaborative research project on incomes and inequality in China organized by Chinese and international researchers, with assistance from the National Bureau of Statistics. For the purpose of studying income inequality and consumption inequality, we only use CHIP year 1995, 1999 and 2002 data to accomplish the empirical analysis.

CHIP 1988 is not taken into account since it only surveys household basic consumption expenditures like food, rental houses, fuel, transportation and medical treatment. Many other crucial items like expenditure on home equipment, facilities and services, miscellaneous goods and services are not reported, being inconsistent with the survey data in year 1995, 1999 and 2002. As a result, we are not able to obtain the true aggregated consumption data and necessity goods expenditure shares, in particular for the base group cohort. Equation (1) can therefore never be estimated appropriately to reveal the true income situation for other percentile groups. CHIP 1995, 1999 and 2002 implement consistent survey methodologies and data cleaning, serving the appropriate purpose to calculate food, clothes and utility expenditure shares. CHIP 2007 and 2013, however, fail to include two kinds of household in-kind benefits: (1) the discrepancies between paid rents and market rental prices for home rents. (2) The differences between paid mortgage interests for home owners. The failure of including in-kind benefits would lead inaccurate aggregated income for the base group (Li 2010) so that we could not step further to estimate the true relationship between the necessity goods expenditure and aggregated income. The inconsistency in the CHIP 2007, 2013 comparing to CHIP 1995, 1999, 2002 does not permit us to calculate income defined in (a2). Overall speaking, CHIP 1995, 1999, 2002 are the longest available dataset to allow us to compare time series income inequality and consumption inequality trend consistently and convincingly.

Table I depicts the summary statistics of CHIP reported income inequality and consumption inequality from 1995 to 2002. Column 2 reports income Gini (under the income definition in (a1)); column 3 reports an alternative income Gini (under the income definition in (a2)); and column 3 documents consumption Gini coefficient (including cigarettes expenditures). Overall speaking, both income inequality and consumption inequality increase slightly during the turn of the millennium. The income inequality taking into account the in-kind benefits (a2) rises approximately 5.5 per cent while under the traditional definition it hikes almost 14.7 per cent. In accordance with Li (2010), (a2) provides a better measurement of aggregated household than (a1). It is not difficult for us to discover that the income inequality does not boost significantly during this period by adopting more accurately measured income statistics. Meanwhile, we could never fail to notice the significant gap between (a1) and (a2), particularly for the year 1995. The housing marketization reform during the last five years of twentieth century could serves a powerful explanatory power for the major discrepancies between different income Gini results. Due to the continuous housing market reform policy, the actual paid housing expenditures converge to the market housing prices, eliminating gradually the in-kind benefits, particularly for the rich cohort. Therefore, the astounding income Gini differences measured under different criteria in 1995 should be explained by underreported in-kind benefits for those who benefited from planned economy housing policy.

The reported income inequality level is slightly still less than consumption Gini, which arises the central topic of our paper. We compare the literature documented income inequality from various datasets in Table 2. Yue, Li (2007) reported 0.363 and 0.368 income Gini for year 1995 and 2002, respective, in which outnumber the corresponding consumption Gini for those two years. Except Yue, Li (2007), the vast majority research documented the income Gini is less than the consumption Gini with various micro- level data sources. (Meng (2005), Jin, Li, Wu (2010), Meng (2004), Khan and Riskin (2001), Benjamin, Brandt and Giles (2005), Cai, Chen, Zhou (2010)). The following part reports our Engel's Law results, attempting to provide true relationship between income inequality and consumption inequality in China and supplying one possible unreported “grey income” estimate for certain cohort in China.

Table 3 reports the Engel's Law results from food consumption. The independent variable income is adjusted based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by National Bureau of Statistics. First the Engel's Law of inverse correlation between food share and aggregated income is indeed confirmed that the food share would drop by 0.08\% to 0.12\% in 1995, 0.06\% to 0.09\% in 1999, and approximately 0.10\% respectively if income level raises 1\%. Generally speaking, the high income group significantly underreports aggregated income per se. For example, if we take bottom 30\% as base group, upper income cohort (the rest 70\% in the survey data) on the average has 0.74\% less food consumption share (due to potential underreported aggregated income) under the income definition (a1) in 1995. While under the alternative definition (a2) taking into account the in-kind benefits, the drop of food consumption share for the high income cohort boosts to 1.85\% significantly in 1995. It gives us hint that the revealed income is even less reliable for the upper income group when more accurate measurement is considered to appropriately capture the overall income. When we look at the year 1999 result, upper income group on average responds 1.20\% below accurate food share without considering in-kind benefits while 1.03\% below adjusting under income definition (a2). For the year 2002, the upper income group seems to report the aggregated income more reliably. That said, the regression result generally does not indicate significant deviation of the revealed food share from the true one. We have to pay attention that if we only select bottom 40\% as base group, the reported income is even more distort. For instance, under such criteria, the upper income group significantly underreports food share (due to underreported income) by 2.6 per cent in 1995 and 3.3 per cent in 1999 under income measurement (a2). On the contrary, if we use bottom 10\% as base group, the rest 90\% on the average over reports 0.24\% in 1995; 0.28\% in 1999 and 0.01\% in 2002. We do not literally believe that using only bottom 10\% as base group could generate as convincing results as using 30\% approach since the survey data might not either record the aggregate income for the extreme poverty group accurately or appropriate measure their consumption proportion accurately. Meanwhile, a less populated base group does not provide us adequate confidence to appropriately measure the Engel's Law relationship. Generally speaking, the upper income group inaccurately reports aggregate income, particularly when we consider the in-kind benefits.

Table 4 shows the Engel curve estimation result from clothing consumption. Although clothes are traditionally believed to belong to the category of necessity goods, initial results show that clothing expenditures increase with respect to increase and hence indicate clothes luxury goods in China. Identity recognition for the rich cohort could serve as one possible explanation for increasing consumption on clothing. It could also be the case that employees in the state-owned agencies and corporations underreport the uniform benefits. The clothes share typically hikes 0.02\% to 0.05\% when income rises by each 1\% no matter what income and consumption criteria we adopt for all the available survey years. That said, the Engel's Law for the food and the clothes are not exactly in the same direction and consequently we have to explain the coefficient of upper income dummy in Table 4 in the alternative direction (comparing to Table 3). Again, if we take bottom 30 per cent as base group, upper income cohort significantly over reports clothes share (due to potential income underreporting) by 0.51\% taking into account in-kind benefits etc. (under measurement (b2)) in 1995, 0.11\% in 1999 and 0.06\% in 2002. By comparing column 2 and column 4, an increasing statistical significance is observed if we adopt a more appropriate income measurement (b2), which means the accuracy of reported income is even less convincing for the upper income cohort in the year 1995. The Engel's Law of clothing further reminds us the potential aggregated income underreporting for the rich cohort and thus the true income inequality might be more severe than it is reported directly from the surveys.


We repeat the exercise by segregating the bottom income base group from the rest with respect to utility consumption share in Table 5. Due to data availability we only report year 1995 and 1999 results with income measurement (c2). From the first and third column we could see that utility is empirically confirmed as traditional necessity good by the Engel's Law estimation. Generally speaking, utility share shrinks by 0.11 to 0.18 per cent when aggregated income rises 1 per cent in 1995 and 1999. Similar to Table 3, we could therefore explain the coefficients in column two and four in the similar way of elaborating food consumption share. The utility share is underreported by 0.29\% (significantly) in 1995 and 0.20\% in 1995 due to possible underreported income for the upper income cohort if we take bottom 30 per cent as base group. In short, looking through Table 3 to Table 5, the upper income group might suffer the inaccurately underreported income problem and lead to underestimate of the true income inequality for all the survey years.

able 6 to Table 8 reports the results of X2 approach (using low income non-party member households as base group) with respect to food, clothes and utility share Engel's Law relationship, respectively. In accordance with Li (2010), we only estimate the result with income involving in-kind benefits. In Table 6, we find that the food share is no longer diminishing with respect to aggregated income when considering party membership effect. Gong, Liu and Song (2017) documented significant underreported income and widely existing “grey income” phenomenon of communist party members. The changing sign of the coefficient of income could therefore be a direct result of potential dishonest income report of those party members. We should still notice that the coefficients of log income and upper income dummy variables are mostly positive in Table 6 while negative in Table 3. The same signs of both coefficients give us hint that upper income group, no matter whether taking into account the possible party membership effect, underreports the true income when we estimate the food share Engel's Law. The true income inequality outnumbers the reported one to some extent and we will discuss the details in the later part of the paper.

The result of clothes share estimation in Table 7 (X2 approach) does not differ very much from X1 approach in Table 3. The clothes consumption is still empirically considered to be luxury goods even considering party membership effect. The coefficients of income, upper income dummy variable remain significantly positive and (the same signs) indicate “grey income” possibility of the upper income cohort. Table 8 reports utility estimation results for the year 1995 and 1999, being quite consistent with the estimation results in Table 5. The utility consumption is not only theoretically in the domain of necessity goods but also empirically confirmed. The significant negative signs of income and upper income dummy hints us again the potential underreported income for the rich cohort.

Table 6 documents opposite signs of income and numbers of party members while Table 7 and Table 8 reports the same signs. In other words, food Engel's Law estimates possible income over-report of party members while clothes and utility Engel's Law provide party members’ underreporting estimation results. We need to pay closer attention to the consumption share habits of party members. The food Engel's Law results for the income party members could be misleading since quite decent amount of communists benefits from government subsidized and/or state-owned low-price cafeterias, being not included in the CHIP in-kind benefits consideration. Consequently, extra cautions must be paid when we attempt to illustrate the results in Table 6. As there is no literally documented solid evidence that party members benefit from utility subsidizing, the estimation results in Table 8, to some extent, provide more reliable estimation.

Table 9 to Table 11 record estimation results under approach (X3) for food, clothes and utility share Engel's Law, respectively. Base group here is the bottom X per cent (X varies from 10\% to 40\%) income group with the all family members neither belonging to Communist Party nor working in the governmental institutions or state-owned enterprises. Interestingly, after controlling effects of household working in all government sectors, government institutions, state and local government owned companies, urban collective institutions and state (shared) owned companies, only utility displays necessity good characteristics with diminishing marginal consumption share. However, the coefficients of income and upper income dummy all have the same sign (positive in food share Table 9; negative in clothes share Table 10 and utility share Table 11), indicating possible underreported income for the upper income cohort even after controlling working sectors in government related institutions or corporations. Notably with the coefficients in state owned companies all statistically significant (positive in food share Table 9; negative in clothes share Table 10 and utility share Table 11), the party membership effect in approach (X2) could be more precisely explained by state government owned companies’ effect. Meanwhile most coefficients of local government owned companies have the same significant signs with the coefficients of income. We could make the statement that employees in local government owned companies also have possible unreported income (except the estimation results from the utility share Table 11). Most coefficients of government institutions and urban collective institutions are insignificant. There does not exist significant over-reporting or underreporting income of the members from those sectors in our (X3) empirical analysis results. Generally speaking, controlling effects of household working in state or local government related institutions and companies could generate more detailed and precise estimation of whom may inaccurately report the aggregated income in the survey. From Table 9 to Table 11 we could make the rough statement that upper income class, employees from state and local government owned companies should have had undocumented “grey income” from the consumption habits. The direct calculation of income Gini coefficients from the reported income data might lead to unconvincing conclusion. Most Engel's Law equation estimations point to downward bias of income inequality and it would be adjusted in the next sector to fairly compare the true relationship 
between income inequality and consumption inequality.

Relaxing the base group restrictions of (X3) a little bit, Table 12 to Table 14 provides robustness check results of approach (X4) using low income, non-party workers in all types of companies, reporting Engel equation estimations with respect to food, clothes and utility shares. We have more base observed base group data points in approach (X4) to check the validity and robustness of our estimation results in approach (X3). We do not observe significant differences between the results of (X3) and (X4). Food and clothes consumption are empirically treated as luxury goods with increasing share to income hike while utility is still considered to be necessity goods according to the regression results. Relaxing the range of base group predicts downward biased responded income for the upper income cohort as well. Some of the estimation results (Food 1995) shows party members over-report income while others (Clothes 1995, Clothes 2002) direct the opposite allegation. It is uncertain whether workers in the government sectors would over-report or underreport their aggregate income since the results from food Engel's Law (Table 12) tell the different story from clothes Engel's Law (Table 35). Dividing the occupation more meticulously does generate more detailed and precise estimation if we compare regression coefficients of (X3) and (X4). Nevertheless, robustness checks (X4) defend the validity of using non-party, non-party-dominated low income employees as base group. Most conclusions (such as high-income cohort underreports earnings) remain very similar.


From Table 3 to Table 14 we report most of the estimation results by letting bottom X\% income vary from 10 to 40 per cent. The empirical estimation results do not differ significantly when X is in the range of 20 to 40. It indeed, however, generates a little bit different results if we use only bottom 10 per cent income cohort as base group. The base group data is the scarcest if letting X = 10\% and therefore we are least confident to use estimation results from bottom 10\%. In other word, using bottom 30 or 40 per cent might provide us more reliable and convincing results.

From the empirical exercise (X1) to (X4), people with high income, working in the state/local government owned corporations tend to inaccurately respond to the CHIP survey (typically downward biased). We use Equation (3) and (4) to recover the true aggregate income for each person. The revealed
income inequality and consumption inequality are summarized in Table 15 by assuming reliable surveyed food, clothes and utility consumption share in CHIP 1995, 1999 and 2002.

The overall income inequality is the smallest if not considering in-kind benefits. The average Gini coefficients are 0.282, 0.335 and 0.333 for the year 1995, 1999 and 2002 respectively (approach X1). However, if we treat the definition of income more precise to use the aggregated income including in- kind benefits. The Gini coefficients raise to 0.338, 0.339 and 0.344 respectively for those three years. Adjusting for the possible Communist Party members’ underreporting problem would further boost the income Gini approximately 10 more per cent, say 0.357, 0.374 and 0.377 in 1995, 1999 and 2002. Finally, if the occupation base reported inaccuracy is also taken into account and adjusted according to Equation (3) and (4), the overall income inequality should rise to 0.379, 0.397 and 0.409 for those three years, which is quite astonishing considering the level hiked from the original reported data points. These are the summary of the inequality results we imputed on the high level. If we look at the more detailed separate results, thee estimated inequality from clothes Engel's Law estimation is the highest while from utility remains the lowest. From Table 3 to Table 14, utility consumption is always empirically demonstrated to be necessity good no matter whether we control the high-income dummy, communist party numbers, occupational conditions, with diminishing marginal consumption interests. On the contrary, food and clothes consumption occasionally display the characteristics of luxury goods. Therefore, it could be claimed that estimation from utility Engel's Law provides the most conservative estimation for the income inequality throughout the time period.


Looking at the overall trend of income inequality, the increasing levels (2-3\%) of income inequality from 1995 to 1999 and 1999 to 2002 are almost proportional to the boosting levels of consumption inequality. Somehow it is quite inconsistent with the literature (Cai, Chen, Zhou 2010) arguing alarming spike (8-10\%) of income inequality. We argue that the income inequality is already very high before Chinese housing marketization reform in 1998 if considering the in-kind benefits. If the possible report inaccuracy is adjusted for high income, communist party members, state and local government owned company cohort, the income Gini is already over 0.4 line for all years (0.411 in 1995, 0.425 in 1999, 0.421 in 2002). It reminds us the large income inequality could be existing for very long period, not necessarily the results of swift economic reform and rapid economics development during 1990s. That is to say, the “grey income” for the high income, communist party members, state and local government owned company cohort could contribute significantly to the overall income inequality before and after the marketization reform is executed.


Table 16 summarizes our findings on income and consumption inequality and compares our results with the vast literatures. Even with our most conservative approach X1, the income inequality is higher than consumption inequality by 4.7 to 7.6 per cent. With the most detailed approach X3, the income inequality on average outnumbers the consumption one by 28.0 to 34.8 per cent. The income Gini from our most conservative approach X1 lies in the range of existing literatures while from X3 the inequality statistics are over most of the literatures’. For instance, the highest income Gini 0.450 in 2002 is estimated with NBS data by Bai, Zhang and Tang 2015, adjusting for the structural underreporting from various income sources. Our estimate for 2002 is between 0.344 and 0.421, taking the alternative approach adjusting the aggregated income from households with different occupations and party membership statuses. Other scholars (Ding, He and Zhu 2017; Wang and Li 2013) also use Engel Curve approach to estimate the relationship between true income and consumption inequality, but with different time period (2002-2007), different data sources (UHS). Their conclusion also differs us claiming that income inequality is still less consumption inequality, although being understated. Other income Gini estimates in the literatures are generally reported for the alternative purposes like measuring the urban- rural income gap, return to education and other public policies. For instance, the income Gini are reported as 0.240, 0.260 in 1995, 1999 with UHIES data (Meng 2005); 0.250, 0.280 in 1999, 2002 with CUHS data (Jin, Li, Wu 2010); 0.332 in 1995 with CASS data (Khan and Riskin 2001); 0.363, 0.368 in 1995, 2002 with CASS data (Yue, Li 2007); 0.370 in 1999 with RCRE data; 0.330 in 1999 with NBS data (Benjamin, Brandt and Giles 2005).

There could exist alternative structural or reduced form econometrics methodologies to unveil the true income distribution among the population. For instance, an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) (Deaton and Meullbauer 1980) or its modification form (Aguiar and Bils 2013; Ding, He and Zhu 2017) could be used to precisely estimate the real income for individuals with various identity, occupations, locations, social statuses and income sources. However, the assumptions for those structural forms estimation could add extra complications and rely more data measuring techniques. In our Engel's Law estimation approach, only food, clothes and utility shares are assumed to be accurately reported for all individuals. It is not necessary to assume the absolute amounts of necessity goods consumptions are exactly documented. Meanwhile, the assumptions of approaches (X2), (X3) and (X4) are even weaker than the original Engel's Law approach (X1). For instance, in the approach (X3), we only need the income validity of the low income cohort with no government related influences. At the last step the robustness checks are examined to enhance the credibility of our empirical analysis.


Our analysis attempt to solve the puzzle of the literatures. We are educated that consumption inequality should be less than income inequality from both economic principles and empirical evidences in other countries. We are literally not sure if there exist behavioral deviation of the consumption habits of Chinese consumers from the traditional “rational agents”. This paper tends to provide an alternative explanation from a different angle. From our empirical results, we find the income inequality revealed from CHIP 1995 to 2002 should be at least 4.5 to 7.6 per cent higher than consumption inequality with the most conservative estimation. Other research like Wang and Li (2013) also adjusts the imputed income but fail to solve the income-consumption puzzle, claiming only less consumption inequality’s dominance over income inequality.


\subsection{Concluding Remarks}

Understanding income-consumption relationship is of vital importance in the territory of labor economics. We intend to provide preliminary evidence to defend the consistency of income-consumption relationship across the nation. At the same time, we contribute the existing income inequality literature an alternative empirical methodology to measure the true income inequality between 1995 and 2002 in China. On the high level, in imputed income inequality is 8.4\% to 31.8\% higher in 1995; 9.0\% to 36.5\% higher in 1999; 5.0\% to 28.4\% higher in 2002 than CHIP reported income inequality. And the true income inequalities dominate consumption ones by 7.5\% to 30.7\% in 1995; 7.6\% to 34.8\%; 4.7\% to 28.0\% in 2002. The empirical estimations could also help estimate the possible “gray income” of households benefited from communist party membership, occupational off-the-books opportunities. The most astonishing finding is that is income inequality in 1995 is already above 0.40 alarm line and remains pretty constant during the housing marketization reform and economics prosperity era. The usual statement is therefore short of empirical supports that increasing earnings inequality is the outcome of economic development. The summary statistics also show the importance of taking into account the in-kind benefits as part of aggregated earnings (Li 2010), which acts pivotally in the research of estimating income, calculating return to education, evaluating public policies.

There leave plenty of rooms for further research. For instance, similar approaches could be implemented to impute the true income distribution for other countries, in particular those emerging economics that suffer severe corruption problems. Also, if we are permitted more available detailed food consumption data like in-home dining expenditures, further steps could be taken to estimate the real aggregated income distribution with an enhancing validity. Using imputed true income also helps other economics research projects like evaluating tax reform policy near the end of 20th century. These meaningful and exciting projects certainly deserve future exploration.
